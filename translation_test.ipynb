      " Hello and welcome everyone. I'm Corey Hofstein and this is Flirting with Models, the podcast that pulls back the curtain to discover the human factor behind the quantitative strategy. Corey Hofstein is the co-founder and chief investment officer of Newfound Research. Due to industry regulations, he will not discuss any of Newfound Research's funds on this podcast. All opinions expressed by podcast participants are solely their own opinion and do not reflect the opinion of Newfound Research. This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a basis for investment decisions. Clients of Newfound Research may maintain positions and securities discussed in this podcast. For more information, visit thinknewfound.com. My guest in this episode is Adam Butler, chief investment officer at Resolve Asset Management. Adam's story is a near quintessential example of my belief that every investor's approach is colored by their experience. From nearly blowing up his firm's office, he's now a member of the Newfound Research team. He's also a member of the Newfound Account at his first job, experiencing the tech wreck firsthand, and going all in on the commodity and emerging market supercycle narrative. It took three frying pans to the face, his words, not mine, to finally rebuild his mental framework from the bottom up. The evolution of his thinking ultimately led him to embrace what he believes is the ultimate gift, embracing uncertainty and strategy specification as a means of exploiting the benefits of diversification. I hope you find this conversation just as entertaining and enlightening as I did. Adam, really excited to have you here with me today and really looking forward to this chat.\n",

      " Well, I was sort of shell-shocked for a little while. It took me a little while to discover that I wasn't going to go back into finance to figure out what I wanted to do instead. I'd always really enjoyed computer programming. So I went back and did a program in computer programming and learned Java and VBA, HTML, and some integrated development environments from IBM, which were pretty new at the time, and then ended up landing a position at IBM in their professional services division. They started me off in pretty well the worst job I've ever done, which was quality assurance for the programming team, where I lasted for all of about six weeks before they moved me into an account management position with their consulting division, which was much, much more interesting because I got to interface with all of the different members of the development team, from the architect to the programming lead to design and the business analysts as well. And so that was really interesting because I got to experience firsthand what the disconnect is between the two. The business side of an engagement and the technical side of an engagement. And, you know, really sales and business don't speak the same language as programming and development. And to be able to translate is actually a really neat skill. And it's a skill that I use all the time to this day.\n",

      " So it's really interesting to me here with the complete benefit of hindsight and knowing where your career trajectory is taking you, you're somewhat unintentionally building the foundations of a quantitative investing platform. You've got the psychology undergrad, which will eventually be very useful for behavioral finance. You've built out the programming skillset, the communication side of bridging the technical and the non-technical. You have your experience investing. So it's interesting while totally unintentional, you have laid the foundation for becoming a quantitative investor, but to tie back to the narrative. So this is the early days of the.com era. If I've done my math correctly here, I know there was a lot of pressure at that time to go startup. You were obviously at big tech. Did you ever feel that push to throw your hat in the\n",

      " Yeah, I've been communicating. Some friends of mine had moved into the startup arena and the internet startups and had put a bunch of illusionary money in their pockets, right, in the form of company shares. So I eventually decided to take the leap and I joined a small startup, internet startup, on their account management team and was there to see this share price run up from about $7 to the mid-30s. And the headcount at the company go from about $30 to $150 in a span of about 18 months. And then literally in three months, we went from $150 to about $40. The share price went from $35 to $10 or $12. And then the next three months, the headcount went to $20 and the share price went to $5 or $6. And eventually I was walking the street. My wife at the time was working at Boston Consulting Group, which had a huge, huge, internet consulting practice in Toronto. I think it was their headquarters for internet consulting. And so they'd really built up headcount and had some really extravagant off sites and it was boom times for them. So mid-2000 or early 2001, they did a massive cut. And so my wife and I were directionless at around the same time. And so we decided that we'd take that opportunity to go travel. And so we went together to Bangkok, Thailand for a couple of years. Fortunately, we had some friends that were working at a large private school in Bangkok and they submitted our resumes to their management and put in a good word for us. And we secured a position there. And it was a boys' school, 6,000 boys from kindergarten to grade 12. So it was literally like the energy of a nuclear weapon went off every day. It was just incredible energy. And I just had a blast. I taught math and physics to English reversion students from grade seven to grade 10. It was just incredible. While I was there, just a tremendous experience.\n",

      " So with the complete benefit of hindsight here, we know you're eventually going to get caught up in this global commodity and emerging market super cycle narrative. And I find it really interesting that you are living in Thailand when the beginning of that brick narrative really took off. And so I guess my question is, had you been keeping your pulse on the finger of the market this entire time? Were you made aware of this super cycle narrative because you were living in Thailand? Or was it really something else entirely that got you back into the markets?\n",

      " I was absolutely obsessive about tracking the markets, but it wasn't because I was in Thailand, I think. Thailand missed out on a lot of that boom cycle. It hadn't really recovered from its currency devaluation, and it didn't have any real natural resources to speak of. So, you know, it wasn't one of the bricks. It wasn't one of the economies that really benefited from that super cycle. But I was obsessively reading the monthly reports from Don Cox at the time, who you mentioned earlier in our chat. So he had come up with this thesis about this commodity and emerging market super cycle. And his thesis rested on this saying that he had that he repeated all the time. And it went, the best investment opportunities come from areas where those who know it best love it least because they've been disinclined. And he was referring to the executives of the major mining company. There was no way in hell they were going to start committing any meaningful capital to new projects in the resource area because they'd just been burned so badly from scaling up their production into the teeth of the last resource downswing. So his thesis was that there is this enormous new source of demand, which arose from the market. And it was a migration of rural Chinese and rural Brazilian and rural Indians into this new middle class, where they would begin to embrace consumerism in the way that the West had embraced it 100 years earlier. And that this was going to prompt this massive super cycle in demand for iron ore, crude oil, but also the migration from a primarily rice and vegetable based diet, to more of a meat based diet was going to mean that there was going to be huge demand for grain feeds and the fertilizer components to be able to ramp up the production of grain feeds. And so you wanted to invest in phosphates and potassium and the potassium and phosphate mines that produce those. And those are fairly concentrated industries around the world. There's only a handful of potassium mines. The largest phosphate mines are in Morocco and in the southern US. And they're all owned by the same three or four companies. I caught on to that early and as an advisor did very, very well for clients in the 06, 07, 08, early 08 period, by having some knowledge of the Canadian oil sands benefited from this whole narrative of crude oil scarcity. And there was some rumor that the major Saudi oil fields were not nearly so well stocked as the Saudi government had been suggesting. And so there was going to be this major oil shortage. And there was going to be this major crunch in crude production. And therefore, crude prices are going to skyrocket. And we saw some of that play out right. And I was able to take advantage of that as an expert in that narrative. But of course, we all know that that narrative ended cataclysmically in 2008.\n",
      "我对追踪市场非常着迷,但不是因为我在泰国,我认为当时我一直在痴迷地阅读唐·考克斯的月度报告,他早些时候在我们的聊天中提到过他提出了关于这个商品的论文,并提出了市场周期的增长他提出这个论文,他一直重复着这个叙述他说,最好的投资机会来自那些喜欢它的人他从经济上说,它不是一个生产<unk>的地区,它不是一个真正受益于那个巨大的周期的蔬菜但是,当时我一直在痴迷地阅读唐·考克斯的月度报告,因为他之前在我们的聊天中提到了这个时期的增长所以他提出了这个论文,他说,他一直在重复这个叙述,他说,最好的投资机会来自那些喜欢它的人,他们从经济上说,它不是一个巨大的市场周期他认为,他认为,最好的投资机会来自于那些地区,因为我们没有任何新的投资,因为他们正在寻找新的市场,所以他们开始生产<unk>的市场,因为他们想要从沙漠开始,所以他们开始了新的市场需求在2008年年初开始,他们开始了投资,因为他们知道\n",

And I mean, that certainly was the case for me in so many endeavors. But definitely that whole commodity super cycle, I was in deep and I knew everything there was to know. I could quote Don Cox. I could quote from the annual reports for BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto and all the major oil sands companies. I knew all the major reserves of all the major oil fields, natural gas, the substitution ratio for petroleum versus natural gas, all that kind of stuff. And I thought because I had all this information that I was better positioned to predict the future. That's the critical mistake I think that investors make.\n",

      " So I almost feel bad continuing the story because we know how it's going to end. We know that eventually this super cycle story is going to fizzle out, but not before you actually almost seem to be proven correct, right? Because post 2007, after financials sold off, the commodity and energy sector continued to do incredibly well into early 2008, which I can only imagine at that point served to confirm your biases even more.\n",
      "我们知道这个超级周期的故事最终会失败,但不是在你实际上几乎似乎被证明是对之前,对吧?因为2007年后,金融卖掉后,大宗商品和能源部门继续做得非常好到2008年初,我只能想象在那个时候为确认你的偏见提供了更多的.\n",
      "******\n",
      "******\n",
      " Oh, absolutely. It was a huge confirmation of my narrative. And Don was early to the whole housing collapse and what the impact was going to be on US financials. And so, you know, I was early to my inputs on Fannie and Freddie and some of the European banks. So that helped. But at the same time, you still had this massive run in the potassium, the potash companies, the fertilizers, the oil sand companies were still in a massive run right up into June of 2008. So I was under the impression that this commodity super cycle was going to persist in the face of this credit and housing collapse. And so that ended up being obviously a grave error and would have been a catastrophic error for me had I not also had some of these other hedges on in the bank puts and just general short financials. My partner, Mike, always says that crisis is what prompts change, right? Nobody goes to God on prom night. So it was this perpetual. Prom night from 2006 to 2008. It was prom night from mid 97 to mid 98. It was prom night at IBM and at the startup in late nineties, early two thousands. So, you know, those were three frying pans to the face. Like you can't look at yourself in the mirror and say, think anything other than, wow, I was under a major misunderstanding there. I really wasn't sure I was going to come back to finance after the 2008 crisis, because I'd sort of built my beliefs about myself. I was trying to figure out what was the value that I could provide to clients around the idea that I could beat the market through a deeper understanding of the machine. And when I discovered that it didn't matter how deep my understanding was that the machine can't be understood from a reductionist framework, I really didn't know where to turn. And that was a really, really challenging time for me. And I almost went back to law school. And did a complete shift in career. I was learning through that. Well, I mean, just having a great business partner, Mike Philbert, just sort of stumbling on some really neat new ways to think about the world that I was able to figure out how to navigate back to a productive career in finance.\n",
      "然而,这对我的看法是极为重要的,因为我对房地产和金融危机的看法是:如果我能从一个低成本的企业中获得一笔资金,我将能够从一个低成本的企业中获得一笔资金所以,我觉得我发现了一个非常严重的错误,而且这对我来说是灾难性的所以,我发现了一个非常严重的错误,我发现了一个非常严重的错误,我发现了一个巨大的错误,我发现了一个巨大的错误,我发现了一个巨大的错误,我发现了一个巨大的错误所以,我觉得我觉得我真的没有办法从一个低成本的企业中获得一个新的价值所以,我觉得我觉得我真的没有办法从一个低成本的企业中获得一个真正的价值所以,我觉得我觉得我真的没有办法从一个低成本的企业中获得一个价值所以,我觉得我觉得我真的没有办法从一个低成本的企业中获得一个价值所以,我觉得我觉得我真的没有办法从一个低成本的企业中获得一个价值\n",

      " So Adam, if you'll let me, I'd really love to begin, set the tone for our listeners with a juxtaposition that I think is sort of fun. And it begins with a blog post you wrote titled The Narrative is Reality. And in that post, you write, to quote, For me in the mid-nots, Don was the guardian of the trend, and I was a full-on card-carrying member of this cult. Now, Don here refers to Don Cox, who was a very prominent strategist in the early 2000s, particularly around the commodity and emerging market supercycle narrative. And you go on to say in the blog post, quote, Now, I want to juxtapose that with a draft of an article you sent me just a few weeks ago. It was actually a citation in that draft, where you cite a paper titled Cleaning Large Correlation Matrices, Tools from Random Matrix Theory, which is a 165-page monograph for practitioners all about techniques derived from random matrix theory that they can use, to deal with in clean, ill-conditioned correlation matrices. And I bring up this juxtaposition only because I think it so well highlights the evolution of your thinking and your thinking in investments and why I'm so excited to have this conversation with you today. And so with that, I'd really just love to start at the beginning. Can you take us back to when you really first started getting interested in investing?\n",

      "******\n",
      "******\n",
      " Well, yeah. I mean, like I said, right, crisis necessitates change. And when I discovered that my previous way of thinking about the world was fatally flawed, then I had no framework. I had no compass. I was an empty vessel. And only when you're empty are you ready to receive. So around that time, it was actually while I was on vacation, I was lying by a pool at the South Seas Hotel in Miami, South Beach. And I stumbled on this presentation through the Long Now Foundation by a fellow named Philip Tetlock. And for those who don't know Dr. Tetlock's story, his career, the way I think about it, sort of had two phases. And I'm much more familiar with his first phase than his second. But the first phase was when he graduated from university, his specialty was applied psychology. I think I could be slightly off, any of these facts, but I'm directionally in the right direction. So he graduates with a degree in applied psychology, goes to work in the intelligence community in Washington. And he starts out as an analyst and he's documenting the forecasts, what all of the major military generals and heads of the intelligence agencies have to say about what's going on in the Russian polyboro. And they're all making forecasts about what they think is going to happen. So he's documenting this, taking notes, and he's responsible for circulating the notes and reading them out at these next intelligence briefings. And what he discovered after a few years of doing this was that these senior officials, these senior experts make forecasts about what was going to happen. And the next meeting, he'd read out what their forecasts were, and they didn't jive at all with what had actually played out. And so he began to wonder whether or not, you know, these are the people at the very top of their field, the intelligence and military, and they can't figure it out at all. So can anybody figure it out? And so I guess he went back into academia and he pulled together a resource to do this long-term experiment. And he recruited 280 experts from a wide variety of fields. And I want to say about 15, 16 years of experience on average, average education level master's degree. These were top journalists and economists and intelligence and military officials, et cetera, senior people in politics. And he asked them a hundred questions each. And they were, they were really well conceived. Questions. They had very specific answers. And then the people were always also asked to give their probability that they believe is going to happen. I don't know. Do you think that inflation the European and will rise above 3% in the next five years? Yes or no. Okay, great. What probability do you ascribe to your answer? Oh, 65%. Okay. Thank you. So, so, so a hundred questions like that. And then after 15 years, he aggregated all of his, all of these answers. So it's 28,000. A sample of 28,000 questions, right? So you draw some pretty meaningful conclusions. And the top four or five conclusions were number one, that experts are no better at forecasting than you would expect from random guesses that they are universally overconfident, though. There are certain experts that are better calibrated than other experts in terms of their level of confidence, even though they're typically, they're not a lot more accurate. None of them, not one single person demonstrated an ability. To forecast better than random guessing. So there were no outliers whatsoever. So more interesting discoveries, for example, experts were less well calibrated in their forecasts when making forecasts in their own field of experts, the experts that were cited most frequently in the news who, or who appeared more frequently on the radio or on TV were markedly less well calibrated in their forecasts than the experts that toil in obscurity. If you translate that, how you view the world, what you take from what experts are saying on TV or what your newspaper, obviously this has a profound effect on your interpretation of events. And so one of the interesting things was that Dr. Tetlock ran some really simple algorithms alongside these experts in order to see whether these algorithms had better forecasting ability. So stuff like just linear regression, right? Will the trend, the current dominant trend persist? Mean reversion. Will the phenomenon eventually revert to the long-term mean? And over the short term, the trend based methods worked really, really well. And over the long term, he discovered that most things revert to their long-term mean. And these very simple rules based methods massively outperformed the experts and delivered forecasts that were meaningfully better than random guesses. That was one major piece of the puzzle that began to drive me towards systematic thinking. So it was about that time that I started digging into some of the papers on systematic investing. And one of the first ones that I stumbled on, which I to this day think is one of the first ones that all new quants stumble on, was this paper, a quantitative... What is it by Faber?\n",
      "我说,就像我说过一样,危机需要改变现在,我发现我以前的思考方式是非常错误的这段时间,我发现我遇到了一个非常有趣的介绍,由一位名为 Philip Tetlock 的专家撰写的关于情报的专家对于那些不知道如何在网络上进行调查的人来说,我没有指南我是一个空洞的容器好吧,我对他的第一阶段更熟悉了好吧,他的第二阶段比他毕业时更熟悉但是,当我开始从大学毕业时,我开始研究这些事实,我开始系统地向学术界提出这些问题但是,在华盛顿大学的研究人员的研究中,他们发现这些问题非常简单所以,他们经常使用一种非常简单的方法来预测这些事情所以,在研究这些问题之后,他们开始用一个非常简单的方法                                   \n",

      "******\n",
      "******\n",
      " A quantitative approach to tactical asset allocation. Exactly right. Yep. That really set a foundation for what turned out to be a completely, almost a brand new career, even though I was in the same field. So we started out using, in practice, many of the techniques that Faber described in his quantitative approach to tactical asset allocation and his sector relative strength paper. And we didn't have any real programming expertise. We didn't have any real tools at the time. I got the most that I could get out of Excel, but it ended up, Excel is just unbelievably tedious. I know I'm offending a huge cross-section of quantitatively oriented thinkers out there, but I find Excel just to be excruciating to work with. So I outsourced some of the research to another group of quants who had been using more advanced tools and who were able to run some strategy tests for us. So it's just really simple stuff. Taking the MSCI, a cross-section of liquid MSCI equity indexes and running a relative strength slash timing, quote unquote, dual momentum type strategy on them. And it worked okay. It was over-parameterized. We used one specific look back because it happened to work best in sample, but it was, I mean, it looked really good. And so we put it to work and we put it to work long, short in actual client portfolios. And for the first eight or nine months, we looked like heroes. In fact, I remember a, period in 2011, I think it was August of 2011, the markets had a really steep dip, but it was foreshadowed. Markets had already begun to sort of roll over. And so our models had taken us short into August trading. And so we were short when the markets dropped precipitously, which meant that we went up in client accounts. I don't think we made gains of nine or 10%. And then of course, in September, the Fed intervened. I want to say it was a speech by Bernanke or something like that. Anyway, something happened and markets, rallied by 12 or 13% and our accounts dropped by the same amount. So we gave it all back and more. And this was very difficult for clients to understand or accept. So we abandoned the long, short version of the strategy. And you know, that's probably one of the small milestones that led us to believe that we probably shouldn't try to be overly specific in how we develop the models. And we also need to be conscious of something that you talk about a lot, right? Which is the best example of a long short. And so we're going to talk about that. And I think it's going to be a great example of a long short, which is a great example of a long short. And I think it's going to is a good strategy that clients can stick with. And this long short approach was not something that we felt the clients could stick with long term. So, you know, we moved from that. It was around that time when I was sort of thinking, this is not as far as we can go with this concept. There are better ways. I've been reading some of the work from guys like David Varady. I learned that David was in Toronto. So we started having drinks and lunches. And eventually I reached out to him and said, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. And he said, Hey, would you like to come and join the team?

      " It's about first having an understanding or really a belief system about how the markets that you are contemplating investing in are most likely to work. So what is the basic relationship between risk and return? So if you look at the asset class level, so big muscle groups like global government bonds, US versus international, EFI versus US versus emerging equities, or maybe you can break it down into regions, the major categories of commodities, gold, some of the major currencies, the actual asset classes typically have a return that is linearly a function of risk. So higher risk assets tend to have a higher return. So the slope of the capital market line is positive, and the assets generally line up along that line fairly closely. So they're a pretty good fit. So as a general statement of first principles, we believe that in the asset class space that returns are a function of risk and that that relationship is broadly linear. Axiomatically, it means that all major asset classes have approximately the same Sharpe ratio. And so then once you've got this basic belief, then you can sort of turn to the portfolio optimization machine and say, what type of optimization allows you to build a mean variance optimal portfolio using only the assumption that all of the asset classes are linear? And that's the basic question. that all asset classes have the same Sharpe ratio. And there are some obvious answers. If you believe that you can forecast volatility and that the correlations between the assets are broadly similar, then an inverse volatility weighted portfolio of those asset classes approximates the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio. If you believe that you can measure covariances, so measure both volatility and correlation, and generate reasonable estimates for those, then you can use the same Sharpe ratio to measure the same asset class. So, let's say you have a portfolio that has assets that are better than random, and you believe again that asset classes have approximately equal Sharpe ratios, then the equal risk contribution portfolio is the max Sharpe, the ex-ante max Sharpe portfolio. Conditional on the fact that you don't have any active views on returns. Now, if you do have active views on returns, then you can use a mean variance framework. And so this is really the evolution to adaptive asset allocation. Adaptive asset allocation is a mean variance optimization based on some systematic active views. So in our early thinking, we used momentum, cross-sectional asset class momentum to inform our active views. So we wanted to maximize exposure to assets with positive momentum and minimize exposure to assets with zero or negative momentum. But we also want to minimize overall portfolio volatility, making use of information that we can glean from the correlation matrix, from diversification. And so that really is adaptive asset allocation in a nutshell. We're trying to maximize the characteristics of the portfolio that we want to emphasize, like momentum, but you can expand it to enterprise value EBITDA or price of sales or trend or carry. We want to maximize those characteristics while minimizing overall portfolio volatility, which is all you do as part of a mean variance optimization.\n",

      " Very often when mean variance optimization comes up, and really just optimization in general, there's this debate between the simple and the complex. And there's a whole lot of literature dedicated to trying to find the balance and the out-of-sample success of very simple and naive methodologies like 1 over n and acknowledging that optimization techniques are very often unintentionally error maximizers, that they will take those statistics about which we are most uncertain and unintentionally overweight them.

      " There's really two different concepts embedded in that statement, right? One is the question of when and how is optimization likely to deliver better results than naive methods? And two, how to best make use of ensemble methods? So probably we should unpack those different concepts separately, right? And we could start with optimization. But we started to get there with this discussion of the optimization machine. But I mean, really, the question of whether naive or optimal diversification through numerical optimization, which one of those or along the continuum between those, what's most effective, is a function of what we believe to be true about our investment universe. So, for example, if you look at one of the most popular papers that weighs in on this question, a paper called Optimal vs. Naive Diversification by DeMiguel, Garlapi, and Upel. In 2009, they examined the performance of portfolios formed using naive methods like equal weight, 1 over n, relative to some very complex optimizations using Bay-Stein shrinkage and all kinds of different complicated applications. But they apply it to a really equity-centric universe. So, for example, one of the universes that they run, this naive versus optimization-based process. And what DeMiguel did was he put together a list of 10 industry groups from the Ken French Library, which anyone can download. I would encourage you to download it and look into this yourself. So, I just finished actually running some tests on that universe. And what DeMiguel and his crew found was that optimization is not as useful as just 1 over n methods and allocating to this industry group. And candidly, I started my investigation. I was kind of skeptical of that claim because they used some really strange parameterizations. They were using 5- and 10-year monthly lookbacks. So, I mean, the information decay on their volatility and correlation estimates based on that length of lookback obviously raised questions about whether there's any information content at all. So, I thought that we could use some, you know, use daily data, which is provided for free, use shorter lookback horizons, and come up with some more information. And I thought that we could use some, you know, use daily data, which is provided for free, use shorter lookback horizons, and come up with some more information. And I thought that we could use some, you know, use daily data, which is provided for free, use shorter lookback horizons, and come up with some more information. So, I ran it. And the fact is I couldn't. The results from the optimization methods did not work as well. We ran minimum variance, max diversification, inverse fall, inverse variance, ERC, and a couple of heuristic methods like the hierarchical minimum variance. And we couldn't make head or tails of it. None of them made any difference. The equal way completely dominated.\n",

      " So this is a topic near and dear to my heart. We run a number of tactical sector strategies here at Newfound, and our research confirms much of the same, which is that the added informational benefit you get from statistics like volatility and correlation is often offset by the uncertainty with which you are measuring those statistics. And so a naive one over N approach proves to be incredibly robust out of sample. And if we take that a step further and consider introducing trading signals, whether it's value, momentum, or trend, that one over N is important not only because we're trying to balance sector risk, but also we're trying to balance model risk. So by way of example, let's consider a market cap weighted sector portfolio that we were going to run a trend following. In that sort of portfolio, your trend following signal on the utility sector would have very little influence on the overall portfolio success or failure, whereas the accuracy of your trend call on something like the technology sector or the financial sector would have an overwhelming impact compared to the rest of the sectors.\n",

      " So let's unpack these results, right? So you've got this 10 assets, 10 industry groups, all US portfolios of US stocks. We tried a bunch of optimizations. None of them helped. Most of them delivered worse results than one over around. The hell's going on? The culprit, it turns out, is that there is no information in the correlation. So if you decompose the sources of risk through principal component analysis of 10 industry portfolios, you find that about 90% of the risk is in the first principal component. And that in fact, the first principal component is the only statistically significant or economically meaningful source of risk. So in fact, if you regress the returns for each of the industries on the S&P 500, and then you extract the residuals, those residuals contain no new information about the structure of those assets. Which is kind of interesting because what it says from an economic interpretation is that industries, at least according to how they're classified by Fama French, are basically just random portfolios of stocks. They don't introduce any more information about the structure of the market than you would get from just constructing any random 10 diversified portfolios of stocks, right? So that was interesting. And actually, there's a way you can derive the number of industries, independent risks in the portfolio as the square of the diversification ratio. So you find the maximum diversified portfolio and you take the square of the diversification ratio of that portfolio. If you do that for the 10 industry universe, you discover that there's less than one and a half independent bets across those 10 assets. So then we thought, okay, well, that's interesting. I wonder if we can get better results from another of the universes, the 25 portfolios sorted on size and book to market also. And in fact, we do get slightly better results. But even across 25 portfolios sorted on both size and book to market, there's less than two independent sources of return. What is the purpose of optimization? It is to maximize the opportunity for diversification. Well, the fact that there's one and a half or two bets across these 10 or 25 different assets means that there's no opportunity for diversification. Now, if you run it on, for example, the asset universe that we use for a global risk parity portfolio, well, now you've got five independent bets across 12 assets. If you run it on our 48 futures universe, you've got 13 independent bets. So the broad lesson is that mean variance optimization is extremely useful where there are several different independent sources of risk. If risk is all dominated by one risk factor, then there is no opportunity for diversification. And therefore, optimization is truly just operating on random noise. And so it's obviously not going to be useful.\n",

And so in school, I started in engineering. I lasted for about a week. I realized the engineers were not my people. And I went in. Actually, I went through philosophy, physics, psychology, and I landed in psychology. I went through sort of two years. I had never heard of the stock market. My parents were in the medical field and had no interest in markets. They didn't grow up thinking about markets. I discovered markets in my third year over a dinner with a family friend and started by investing using stock bulletin boards. So online, you know, the early internet. I guess I must have had a pretty enthusiastic and compelling pitch because in university, I was living with four housemates and three of their parents gave me a couple thousand bucks to invest using my bulletin board method in small mining stocks. And so I think I had 3000 bucks and I gave him back about 800 bucks three months later. But I didn't learn any lessons from that. I went on and entered in some trading competitions that were hosted by one of those early discount brokers. And I was one of the first brokers in Canada. And it was a Canada wide competition. And we had three months to turn a half a million bucks in fake money into as much money as we could by trading stocks and options. So I proceeded to trade extremely high beta tech stocks using out of the money call options and turned half a million bucks into a million to purely out of luck. It has happened to be on the right side of the market with leverage at the time. And then I repeated the success in the next competition.

      " Thanks for that introduction. And I mean, this is definitely one of the foundational principles that we espouse at Resolve. But it's just the idea that 99.99% of all computational and cognitive energy and markets is devoted to security selection. And this is true because that is the way the industry is structured. So if you look at the organizational structure of any large pension plan or endowment, or of the portfolios of most individual private wealth clients, what you see is that the portfolio has a strategic asset allocation that is set by an investment committee, probably in the case of pensions verified by actuaries. In the case of private clients, it's verified by the compliance departments at the brokerage houses so that it is suitable to what the client has expressed their objectives are and their risk tolerances are. And once that strategic asset allocation is set, it doesn't vary very much. If it does vary, it varies incrementally. It varies incrementally through time based on changes in age or changes in financial situation of the client or based on a change in leadership of the institution. But it certainly doesn't change very much based on tactical decisions of the investment committee. By the same token, if you go one level deeper into each of the different sleeves, so you've got typically an equity sleeve or a growth asset sleeve, you've got a fixed income sleeve, and you've got an alternative sleeve. Sometimes that alternative sleeve is arbitrarily divided between stuff like infrastructure and, you know, private equity and venture cap and so-called hedge funds, whatever that means. But within the equity space, now there's an enormous latitude for tracking error. The purpose of the people that are hired within the equity sleeve at the institutions or that are hired as mutual fund managers or SMA managers for private wealth clients is to take active risk in pursuit of active returns. So there's an enormous tolerance for tracking error at the individual security selection level, relative to the tracking error that is tolerated at the asset allocation level. And what that means is that the vast majority of capital that is seeking to arbitrage the opportunities in markets is seeking to arbitrage it within the security space. And there is extreme constraints on those investors that are able to arbitrage the mispricings at the asset allocation level. And so the opportunity at the asset allocation level to do that, to generate alpha by harvesting mispricings or taking advantage of mispricings is much larger and in our opinion, also much more sustainable because it's just very, very few players out there that are actively looking to arbitrage those opportunities.\n",

      " Yeah, I mean, I think that this is a critical piece of the puzzle that many systematic investors neglect. It's this first step, which is asking the question, is there anything magical about the way that I've specified the problem? And just going back to the 200-day moving average or the 10-month moving average from MEB, right? Is there anything magic about the 10-month moving average? Many papers on trend are written using a 12-month look-back horizon. And that's a part of the scientific process, right? The ivory tower requires that you build on the papers that have been written before yours. And so if the first paper that comes out on momentum, like Jagadish and Tippmann, comes out using 12-month momentum with a skip month, well, I'm going to say 95% of all papers written on momentum since 1992 were specified in exactly the same way. Because the idea is to build on, hold that specification constant, that definition of momentum constant, and explore things that... That touch on that specification, right? But Jagadish and Tippmann, they randomly decided that they're going to use 12-1 as their specification. They actually used lots. But then Carhartt used 12-1 and that took off. But the point being that there's nothing magical about 12-1. Novi Marx proved that. Stambaugh proved that. They specified other models that worked just as well. The guys at Pim van Vliet and the guys at Robico use idiosyncratic momentum. There's lots of different ways that are just... There's lots of different ways that are just as useful. There's nothing magical about 12-1. There's nothing magical about 12-month look-back-for-trend following or a 200-day moving average. So we sort of start by thinking about why is that 12-month look-back horizon meaningful? Is it? And if it isn't, why are we married to it? Why are we married to 10 months or 12 months? Especially if you examine the literature and you see that a one-month look-back horizon for trend over the past 200 years has been just as effective as a 12-month look-back-for-trend. Three months has been just as effective. Sure, they've got Sharpe ratios that differ by 10 or 15 basis points, but the standard error of the Sharpe ratio is on the order of 30 or 35 basis points. So in other words, they are statistically indistinguishable from one another. So why are we going to zero in on a 12-month look-back when we know that there are 5 or 10 or 15 or 20-year periods when a three-month or a one-month or an eight-month look-back is going to completely dominate a 12-month look-back?\n",

I think most people that read Meb's paper think that they have, if it's sort of the first paper, first few that they've read in that field, believe that they've stumbled on this holy grail, right? There is something truly magical about this 10-month moving average, right? Markets just are predestined to behave in a way that makes them respond to a cross of the 10-month moving average. 10 months is about 200 trading days, so the 200-day moving average. So everyone, I think, starts in this, or most people start in this really deterministic place where it's the parameters that matter, right? This 10-month moving average is magic. It's not that this general concept may have some merit. It's that this particular strategy. This particular signal is the holy grail. And once you sort of back up and realize that there's no deterministic reason why markets should trend at a 12-month horizon but then not trend at a 6-month horizon, then you also begin to realize that there's this gift that these guys aren't taking advantage of. And the gift is the fact that the 6-month strategy and the 12-month strategy and the, you know, let's get one level granular, more granular. The 26-day strategy. And the 192-day strategy have the same expected Sharpe ratio, but they are not perfectly correlated with one another. In fact, our head quant, Andrew Butler, has just derived the, like, analytically what the expected correlation is between trends of different horizons and for holding periods of different horizons too. And so in reality, you can get about two and a half independent bets just by using different lookbacks or a horizon. So you get a variety of different lookbacks combined with a variety of different holding periods in order to form your portfolios. So you get this massive diversification free lunch. And even better, now I don't have to make any decisions based on what's worked best in the past in order to specify my model. I can use them all. I can say, I'm going to take some random number of lookbacks to measure my trend or my momentum somewhere between whatever, two and seven. This sample picks four. Now I'm going to pick four random lookbacks. Okay. We use a space filling algorithm, but we still, it's randomized. Random lookbacks between basically the range that momentum and trend has been identified, 20 days to about 300 days, randomly select four numbers. Maybe it's 29 and 44 and 161 and 270 days. Right? And so now I've got four different momentum lookbacks. Well, I'm going to have to put those together somehow. I'm just, am I just going to average their raw returns? Am I going to average their sharp ratios or their Omega ratios? Am I going to examine the time above trend? So that's the quantity. How am I going to transform it? Am I just going to use the raw numbers and plug it into the optimizer? Or am I going to say that assets that are above the median at each lookback horizon, get a one and below the median, get a negative one, and then just add up those ones and negative ones across the four lookbacks and feed that score into the optimizer. Right? I don't know. They all seem like they're perfectly useful. It's just examining the market, using different assumptions about the granularity of information. Right? Rank might be perfectly legitimate. Is rank better than raw, better than binary? Well, they all seem to work just as well in simulation and they're all theoretically just as reasonable. So we use all of them. And then what's the best optimization to use? Do we maximize the sharp ratio? Do we find the mean variance optimal portfolio at our target volatility? Do we maximize the sharp ratio? Do we just make the assumption that all the assets that we like have equal expected return and therefore the minimum variance portfolio of those assets is the mean variance optimal portfolio? There's actually five or six different ways to optimize it and get the same theoretical mean variance optimal portfolio. Turns out in simulation, they all seem to work just as well. So when you put all the combinations of different lookbacks, different numbers of lookbacks, different transforms, different optimization methods together, you get a large number of different sub-strategies. They all aren't perfectly correlated to one another. And so again, you get this major diversification benefit. You get more diverse portfolios. You get portfolios that work in more diverse environments. You're less reliant on a particular type of or length of trend or you're just less reliant on this any sort of specification. You get this more robust, underdetermined or non-deterministic portfolio that works better in practice. You get more broad and complex strategies that are even much more consistent in practice than 80 percent of the sub-strategies. So it's this amazing phenomenon. If you look back at the back test across all of the different combinations of our strategies, you've got some sub-strategies that back test at 0.91 sharp. And we've got other sub-strategies that back test at 1.67 sharp. The standard error is 0.37. So I cannot say with any statistical meaning that the 1.67 sharp strategy is materially better than our 0.91 sharp strategy. I have no confidence that the 0.91 sharp strategy won't outperform the 1.67 sharp strategy in live trading. So I should just use them all. And even better, if I've got 100 sub strategies, and the 50th percentile is 1.2 sharp, when you put them all together, I might get a 1.45 or 1.5 sharp, which is above the 80th percentile of all of the individual sub strategies without me having to choose any parameter specifications at all.\n",

      " So this conversation is reminding me of a quote from Aaron Brown, who last time I checked was the head of risk at AQR. And the quote goes something to the effect of randomness is something we create to learn about something deterministic. And what's really interesting here to me, what it sounds like is you are using randomness in a way and really trying to exploit diversification that with the expectation that for every statistic you're trying to estimate, there is this shroud in this distribution of uncertainty around it. That by leveraging distribution and taking all these random samples, you can try to average all that noise out and come up with a much more stable. Estimate, whether it's of some sort of timing signal, momentum value, even things like volatility and correlation.\n",

      " So the mental model that I use for diversification is really like a 3D graph. When most people talk about diversification, very often they're talking about asset class diversification. Or if you're a quant, you might talk about factor diversification. Or if you are a macro investor, you might talk about some of the macroeconomic influences and diversifying across those exposures. But that's really just one axis of diversification when I think about it. There's these other axes along which you can diversify. There is the how, which would be your process. And those might be the signals you use to manage your investments. And then there's also the when, which is when are you investing? What are the opportunities at that point of investment? How frequently are you rebalancing? How long are you holding for? And if you believe that there is diversification opportunity among those different approaches, when you invest at different times, what asset classes you use, that by expanding your diversification from really one axis to three, you can, in theory, dramatically improve your Sharpe ratio.\n",

      " Well, this is the thing, right? What it does is it increases the ex-ante Sharpe ratio of the portfolio because you're not relying on any particular specification. You've just got a lot more faith in the live trading of a portfolio if you've made very few decisions about how that portfolio should be formed, right? It's funny because a lot of people sort of preach KISS, right? Keep it simple, stupid. And using one moving average, like a 10-month moving average or something, or one look-back period for trend, it sounds like it's simpler. But what it is is it's more fragile because it's forced you to make a really critical decision. And that decision is going to have profound impacts over the performance of that portfolio, especially in the short term. Like if you've got a strategy formed on a 12-month moving average or a 12-month look-back horizon, and a strategy formed on a three-month look-back horizon, are going to provide the same terminal wealth. They have the same expected... X-ante Sharpe ratio. But over the next 10 years, a 12-month look-back horizon could be just god-awful, while a three-month look-back horizon could be magical. And those who chose 12-month because it has worked over the very long term have failed to realize the long term may not apply in the short term.

I have no preference or confidence that that value premium is better expressed using sorts on book value or free cash flow or earnings or sales or enterprise value. I'm sorry, EBITDA. I think all of them work just as well. I do believe in momentum, but I don't have any strongly held beliefs about how to specify it. I would probably use both six month and 12 month momentum. I would use residual momentum as well. Those are really the factors that I probably hold most dear. I'm. Highly enamored with some of the research that's come from Lu Zhang with his Q factor model. And so I would probably seek to emphasize firms with high ROE and low investment. So I think the way that I would approach it is I would take my list of factors. It's probably four, maybe five. And then I would pick a diverse set of specifications for each of those factors. And I would perform sorts. So I would take the top 5% of stocks sorted on. Each of the value factors, top 5% of stocks sorted on each of the momentum specifications, top 5% on ROE, top 5% on investment, different ways to measure investment. There's different ways to measure ROE. So I probably got maybe 15 or 20 sort of groups of 10 or 20 stocks that I like. And then I would form a robust minimum variance portfolio of those stocks that have characteristics that I like. And that just expresses. The belief that I believe that all of those stocks that I selected will outperform the broader market, but I have an equal expected return for all of those stocks. And therefore the mean variance optimal expression of the fact that I think all of those stocks have the same expected return results in a minimum variance portfolio.

      " Correct. So I learned all the wrong lessons. I came onto the trading floor thinking I was God's gift to trading. Well, there's an interesting story in my interview process, which we can delve into if we have time. But I started on the trading desk as a junior analyst. And my job was to come up with ideas for advisors and trade switch ideas because really we were a revenue generating desk. And we were to generate revenue by helping advisors to come up with ideas to switch out of one stock and into another to generate commissions. So I had a very small Omnibus account that gave me a small trading account just to sort of stay in the flow of the market. Right. So I was supposed to trade and try to generate some profit for the desk. But really, that Omnibus account wasn't really meant as the primary profit center for the desk. It was really just to stay in the flow, help me to generate ideas. That sort of thing. And I had a very small risk budget appropriately in the beginning. But it was late 97. And from late 97 to about August of 98, you could throw a dart at the NASDAQ board and just keep hitting massive winners. And so that's what I did. But I thought that it wasn't darts. I thought it was really skillful selection of high quality companies. So I was really successful, just purely out of luck. And so I turned that small couple hundred grand into 400 grand pretty quickly. And then they gave me a larger risk budget because they thought that my success meant that I was skillful. And I just kept throwing darts and winning. And they gave me a larger risk budget. Eventually, I was working with the full Omnibus account. And I turned the two million bucks into about eight and a half million. And that was about right into the teeth of long term capital management, the Russian default, the Thai bot crisis. And. I was in the middle of the year, September, October 1998. And that's things really started crashing down around me. All of a sudden, all of the trades, the way out of the money options positions that I had on started going against me. I had levered positions on in some individual stocks. They went against me, but I just kept throwing darts. And if anything, it was a mad scramble. I started throwing more darts to try and make up for my losses. So in the span of just a few weeks, that eight million odd dropped to under two million. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I didn't last much. I was much longer on the trading desk. That was definitely a scarring experience for me. And I didn't actually go back into finance until 2005.\n",

      " It's funny, we were just talking about merger ARB, and so there was a manager, John Paulson, who now is very popular and very famous. We had a lot of capital with their merger ARB fund, and they had another fund that was a little bit of an event-driven arbitrage, but mainly strategy. And they were that great money manager who could identify which deals were most likely to close, which deals were most likely to break. They had a very good track record, but it wasn't off the charts. It was just a really solid track record, and we'd been investing with it for many years. About 2006, they started to talk about looking for a way to short housing market. And there's this subprime comes up and shorting CDOs, and me being me, I had to go all the way down the rabbit hole, and I learned everything there was. I could price a credit default swap. I could genuinely... I mean, I was just... I was just in love with this as a trade, but also the asymmetry of that potential payoff. And from there, we started to learn an awful lot more about the asset class. We learned about all the different managers that were trading in the space, and we allocated very heavily. I remember calling clients and saying, I know what I'm about to tell you is ridiculous and crazy, but we need to go big on this. And the clients would say, you've never ever said anything like this, but wow. And I was like, okay, if you have that much conviction. And fortunately, it paid off quite nicely. But again, it was just kind of the math. It really all boiled down to the math. You knew the negative payoff was, say, 3%. We were buying through Paulson and Passport and several of the other funds that we used. We're buying credit default swaps on things that we knew were worth zero because we could see the underlying asset. Think of it almost like an ETF. You knew what the assets were worth in there, but the ETF, imagine if it was trading 100 times more than the value of the asset. And you could buy a put option on $100. It was just amazing.

      " So I want to go back to create some real tangible takeaways here for our advisor listeners to this podcast. Again, going back to the mental map of how you're navigating the alternative space, there are very common portfolio construction techniques that advisors use. A lot of rules of thumb around understanding the breakdown of equities and bonds for individuals, whether it's outcome focused or just some sort of naive glide path. Again, it's commonly my experience that people struggle to figure out how to put alternatives in. And when they then do put alternatives in, the non-transparency of the space, as well as the complexity of the return profiles, often very nonlinear return profiles, makes it very hard to figure out how to use multiple alternatives together. Obviously, you've found great success in that in constructing portfolios, having as much as 50 or 60% in alternatives. I was hoping you could expand on yours. Your process a little of not only just obviously evaluating these alternatives, but how you thought about building a portfolio of them.\n",

      " Back to the return enhancer and risk reducer. And actually, the irony of this all is I'm a fairly efficient markets person. I believe that markets are pretty efficient and money will flow to those opportunities and those opportunities appear if they're there. But that's over the general long term. So private equity, for example, is like equity. It's at the end of the day an equity type return. And you're getting possibly paid for the illiquidity premium. Maybe. Maybe you're just getting paid to be able to invest in smaller companies. And so maybe you're getting that extra return. But it, A, resonated very well with the clients because the clients in my portfolio were typically business owners. And so they appreciate investing in a company. We used to talk about things like insider information is legal in private equity. It's encouraged, right? It's to know everything you can about the investment you're making. It's to know everything you can about the investment you're making versus trying to invest in an opaque space. So we didn't have these grand expectations for certain aspects of it. But we knew that the behaviors of those products would behave somewhere on that security market line. Say private equity might have a little bit more risk because we're concentrated in a certain sector. Then you come down that line into, say, an equity long short hedge fund. Well, in theory, an equity long short hedge fund that's not using leverage, that's a fairly constant, say, long short hedge fund. And if you look at the risk level, you can see that the risk level is somewhere around 80 cents and short 20 cents or somewhere along that line should have a risk level somewhere around 60% equities, like a beta 60% equities. And if it did, then it was a matter of trying to evaluate where the skill level was. But knowing that a good chunk of the returns are going to come from, say, 60% to the equity market. And then kind of pricing that in net of fees and otherwise and just building that portfolio. Again, kind of you're just working on a, if you start with a 60-40 framework for that client. Clients goals and needs, then you just build it out. And so in that 60-40 example of let's say that that equity manager, let's say they, we might have put that bucket into it's probably 60% equity exposure and 40% other and let's call the other risk reducer. And so now we know we've allocated a chunk of that to that. And then there might be other opportunities where it's completely off, you know, managed futures or something. Like that. That's the taster typically for advisors to come into alternatives with their very first taste. And I think most of the managed future strategies are tiny, tiny doses because a, the fees are so fat in a lot of those products that they can't actually create the value that they're trying to create. And then B, it's a systematic strategy. And so it's really hard to evaluate when it's going to work and when it's not going to work. So we shied away from a lot of those things that they just didn't fit into the portfolio. So it had to kind of make sense with the, am I trying to reduce risk here? This thing, a generally an absolute return style vehicle, or could it conceivably produce an absolute return? Then I'll put that in the risk reducer bucket or the bucket that would have otherwise been bonds and vice versa on the equity side. I just use return enhancer style products. So that might be leveraged on a fixed income strategy. That one, it would be, I'd leverage to anything whacked pretty hard. And so trying to price in those fat tits. And diversify those fat tails so that you ha if you have one, you don't have it across the entire portfolio. And that's really where the nuance thing.\n",

You're just very first pass ability to identify a sniff test, if you will, that this isn't going to work, whatever it is.

      " Yeah, it's a great question. And as I think about it, even as you were asking, I think the first one that came to mind was over diversification. So if you're seeing, like you have to break some rules if you want to try to outperform. And by rules, I mean always diversify, always never use leverage. You generally have to, like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, they got wealthy, significantly wealthy by breaking rules. They didn't sell when they should have. They didn't diversify. They concentrated in their positions, but it worked for them. And maybe it didn't work for 99% of the rest of the population, but there has to be some rule breaking. And so in that case, when we see any type of alternative that's just hundreds and hundreds of positions across all these different strategies, even if it's a brilliant macro manager that's taking all these, if they're not willing to take a bet, then oftentimes you're going to lose. You're just going to pay the fee. Again, it's that kind of, I love that. Thinking of it's just a high price T-bill. Massive fees, over diversified, can't produce out any kind of return, even potentially a return, let alone a return that's attractive. So that's one. And then the idea of producing something that's pretty much I can get with just, right. If I think a common criticism was to take a manager and look at their returns and really just almost use like a, wouldn't I be better off just levering up the S&P or levering down the S&P cash and S&P. And could I just get a similar exposure to this? So where's the value in what you're doing? You have to have a great story, but you also have to, I have to believe that the story is there that long, short equity, that's a really challenging way to make money. There's, there's very few managers that can make money on the short side on a regular basis. So why are you short equity when you could just short the S&P long? And if that's the case, why don't you, why don't I just buy an ETF in that regard? But there are managers who have been. Really, really good.\n",

I was always curious, intellectually curious, and just stimulated by challenging myself. In the very early days of my career, actually, I remember I had a great mentor. He was more like a mentor. He says, you know, I know you're going to be okay. I know you're going to be successful. And just remember, don't make your goal to build a big book of clients. Become a client. Figure out, you know, spend the next 20 years. Just, like, learn from your clients. Your clients are smarter than you are. Face it, you know, know it, and realize that. And learn from them and watch how they create their wealth and watch how they do it. And, of course, you know, I had this beautiful perch where I could just watch all of these business owners and kind of wealth creators, if you will, do that. One of them, and two of them actually, came to me in 2011, right around that time frame. One of them had built a very large asset, man, from Rochester and sold to Oppenheimer. Big, meaningful. Bond portfolio, about $30 billion of assets. He was the president, Mike Rosen, and Charlie Silver. And they came to me and wanted to get into the ETF business. And I said, yeah, definitely we can help you at Morgan Stanley. What are you thinking for a strategy? And they said, well, you know, we just want to get into the ETF business. We want to build a company. We haven't really decided on the strategy. I said, you know, if it was me, I would implement this strategy. I saw a lot of institutions doing it where you're basically capturing the kind of growth. Growth of dividend expectations over time. That difference between the actual dividends and the implied dividends. And it was a strategy that, again, I saw just reverse engineering a lot of structured products. Seeing the capital markets desk. Seeing a lot of what the hedge funds were investing as a tool. And I saw with the interest rates as low as they were. With the growth rate of just the overall economy. Maybe the stock market was getting ready to sell off. There was a lack of good liquid alternatives. So I saw real need for, you know, my clients. My clients could invest in dividend swaps. But my neighbor couldn't. And my mom could. And so I just thought it was a wonderful strategy that hadn't been done yet in the ETF space.

      " A swap is nothing more than a financial agreement between two parties. Typically, these are financial institution to institutional investor of swapping an agreed upon asset over time. So over some period of time, there's interest rate swaps, there's lots of different types of swaps, but that's all it is. So you can swap two assets over time with one another. The dividend swap itself is one of the easier swaps to get your brain around because it's based on a pretty simple concept. If the dividends per share of an asset, the market, a stock, anything, are a number, let's just say in the case of the S&P 500, which is really where we focus and we see a lot of value, the dividends per share of the S&P 500 are approximately $53 today and will be this year. We will agree to swap the growth of those dividends or the decline of those dividends for a fixed value, say $53. So I'm going to set a price with you. You and I are going to agree to pay one year from now the dividend of the S&P 500 and you're going to pay me 50 or I'm going to pay you 53 and you're going to pay me either whatever the dividends rise to or whatever the dividends fall to. That's the floating leg of that swap. So it's the realized value of dividends. So whatever dividends are realized to be versus the current implied value, which is what you and I agree on as the price. Those two terms are pretty important. With Divi, the ETF and the way we manage this strategy, what we do is we allocate and again with the dividend swaps, you can actually allocate any time between one year, two years, three years, all the way out 10 years on the S&P 500. What Divi finds to be the kind of that sweet spot of that is the zero to five year term. And we try to equally wait between one, two, three and four years. And then we just roll that first year dividend swap on the S&P 500 out every year. So with that kind of equal allocation, the zero to five year timeframe, we have this nice portfolio. We invest all the capital that comes in into T-bills and use that as the collateral for this dividend swap portfolio. And we end up with a beta to the market or a kind of an overall standard deviation, quite low with a nice decent return, but about a point three.\n",

      " Hey listeners, Cory here. Please pardon the interruption, but before we dive deeper into the realm of dividend swaps, I wanna try to provide a bit of intuition. Whenever I'm trying to understand a new and complex topic, I often try to start with the limits. For dividend swaps, the two obvious extremes are an infinitely length perpetual swap and a bullet one-year swap. In the case of the perpetual swap, the floating leg receives all future dividends of the index, which under basic financial theory, the net present value of all those dividends is simply equal to the current index price, which also tells us the value of the fixed leg. Since the index price is equal to the net present value of all future dividends, any increase in index price implies that future dividends had been underestimated, while any decrease in index price implies that they had been overestimated. Therefore, mark-to-market value of the swap over time should simply be equal to the difference between the current and the future dividends. The investor is holding the floating leg is effectively long the index and all its associated risks and would expect to earn the equity risk premium over time. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have a bullet one-year swap. In this case, the floating leg only bears the risk of the realized dividends accrued over the next year. While the forecast accuracy of realized dividends over a one-year horizon is empirically fairly accurate, investors are only going to be able to see the floating leg over time. Investors willing to bear these risks are compensated with what's called the dividend risk premium. We can use these two extremes to develop a first-order approximation of how we would expect intermediate length dividend swaps to behave. We would expect longer swaps to exhibit more equity sensitivity, while shorter duration swaps would exhibit more sensitivity to uncertainty in short-term dividends. And with that out of the way, back to our regularly scheduled programming. Eric, can you provide some basic intuition around what the dividend risk premium\n",

      " actually is? First of all, you know, dividend, let's say we both agree dividends are 100 today, and we both agree dividends are going to be 110 next year. We're brilliant. We've got our crystal balls associated with us. And we know dividends are going to be 110. And I want to buy a swap, and you want to sell a swap, you're not going to sell it, or I'm not going to buy it from you for 110. Because why wouldn't I just go buy a T bill for no way or something? Why would I want to pay 110 for something that's worth 110 in the future? I wouldn't do that. I would rather put the money in my savings and earn a return on. So now we know it's going to be 110 minus whatever the risk free rate is. Great. But what if, what if the market, what if our crystal ball is a little fuzzy? What if we're wrong? And so then there's a little bit of risk to that dividend. And maybe it's not going to be 110. Maybe it's going to be 105, maybe a three. So now we have to price in that risk. You want to sell because you don't want that dividend risk. I want to, because I believe dividends will be 110. And I'm willing to take a little bit of risk because it doesn't really correlate with my other assets. And that's what I'm looking for. And so we arrive at some number, which in the case of the S&P 500 would probably be 104 or 105. So something like the risk free rate plus about a four or 5% return. And that's kind of how we arrive at this number. And that four or 5% return isn't free. It's not a free lunch because there's risk. Dividends could fall and I might earn zero, but that's how dividends get priced in the dividend market. Because we're a providing a service to the people who don't think dividends are going to rise or to people who maybe no dividends are going to rise, but don't want the risk on their books. If we do have a big sell-off because they have so much other risk elsewhere. And so we're transferring risk and almost like an insurance, there's a cost associated with that.\n",

      " So we have this equity risk premium on the ultra long kind of infinite portfolio shrinking down to some as more things become finite. We have now this kind of dividend risk premium, we'll call it. And it's not linear. And if you go out to about 10 years, that's typically where dividends are traded in years. If you go out about 10 years, you'll find the beta to the equity market is probably about 0.7. And actually, I should unpack one more thing is there's the European market where dividend futures and swaps really first were developed. And there's a lot more literature on that. And so as people are sitting around for, they'll see a lot of information on the European market. And then there's the US market. And they're different. In Europe, dividends are much more likely to get cut. There's no stigma associated with a dividend cut. And companies pay out far more dividend payouts in Europe. And so if earnings are down, dividends are down and vice versa. So there's a lot more risk to the dividend market. But as you look across the S&P. 500, you find that the beta to the 10-year dividend swap might be about 0.6. And then as you come in, it's probably like 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, down to the sixth-year dividend swap. And that's when it really starts to tail off. Because I think we have a lot more visibility of what's going to happen to Coca-Cola over the next five years or the next 10 years and their dividend payments. And certainly, as we come in at 12 months, we have almost perfect visibility on what those dividends and Coca-Cola, as an example. Now, what you're talking about is like an estimation value and then a market pricing value. And that is why we call it the dividend risk premium, which is what's the risk I'm taking or what's the risk I'm requiring? What's the payment return I'm requiring to invest in this shorter market structure? It's about 0.3 or so, I would say, in those. We try to focus on the zero to five-year band.

Because I think that that's first important, and then we'll unpack it to how does the market for dividend swaps behave. The S&P 500 has increased its dividend every year except for three over the last 45 years. So there's only been three down years. Two of them were in the 2000, 2001, and single digit at 5, 6. And then the one, the big daddy, was in 2008, and that was about 20%, 20% decline, depending on which index you're looking. So the dividends of the S&P 500 declined around, and just to kind of really zoom in, so we had a third of the S&P was in financials. They were the single largest in payer, and they didn't cut. They eliminated. They completely wiped out their dividend, right? And still, we had only 18 declines of the S&P 500 that year because Coca-Cola. A lot of companies continued to increase their dividends throughout. In fact, the infotech companies started to really come in and be big payers throughout that time as more and more companies wanted to buoy their lagging stock price. So very, very unique risk event, right? And that was the first and only time we saw a double-digit decline in the S&P 500. So you could consider that the mega fat tail, right? And there's the risk is picking up pennies in front of this potential bulldozer. Right. Right. How often does that bulldozer happen? Well, it didn't happen very often. Most of the time, the average return is around 6.5% growth. And you can kind of almost think about this like earnings growth, right? It should be somewhere on the line with earnings growth, which should be somewhere on the line with kind of overall productivity growth. So in most environments, you're going to get a typical kind of growth path. The standard deviation of that 6.5% is around 6.5%. So we're. We're earning dividend growth at 6.5%. And we're only paying the risk of 6.5%. Not bad, right? That's the real dividend market. But markets are smart and they're going to price some of that in. And so what we found in this zero to five year dividend swap portfolio range, you're going to earn around. And obviously this changes over time, but around 3% to 5%. So you're going to be on average, the market's going to price in like 1% to 2% when the dividends. Are expected to grow. So and so you're only earning that three to five of the dividend growth, but you're also earning everything on your cash. So you're earning the risk free rate plus the three to five. And so as interest rates continue to rise, interest rates rise, you're earning that cash return plus this risk premium, which is that three to 5% on average, most of the time.\n",

      " So in reading a lot of the literature that is out there around dividend swaps, even a year and a half out, when there is a large degree of certainty around what dividends you should actually realize, these dividend swaps do tend to still trade at an economically large discount. And there's this whole pull to realized effect that as you march closer and closer to the final termination date of the swap that you actually get to the appropriate value. I want to spend some time exploring why that exists. We continue to call it a dividend risk premium, which implies that it is truly a risk you're taking on and you're acting somewhat as an insurer to the volatility. And perhaps it's the negative skew of dividends. But it has been proposed in the literature that this might actually be due to behavioral effects. It may actually be a structural bias in the market, a supply and demand issue created by structured products being issued by banks. And then there is obviously the risk argument. I was hoping you could explore that a bit for us and go over some of the arguments as to not only why this has existed, but why we should expect this premium to continue to exist.\n",

      " Okay, so to do this properly, what we first need to do is take a step back and look at what's happening in the derivatives market. All derivatives based on the future price of an instrument, so options, put options, call options, futures contracts, forward contracts, anything that's based on the future price of an instrument is predominantly driven by one thing, which is the price of that instrument. And that's what we all know, and that's what most of us think about whenever we're trading or investing in that vehicle. But it's also based on two other things. One is interest rate risk, which is very easy to hedge. And then this third thing, which is very difficult to hedge, if not impossible to hedge, without dividend swaps, is the dividend risk. Because if you think about when stocks pay dividends, they're constantly going ex-dividend. And if you're entitled to the future price of those stocks, or that index, then you're entitled to everything except for the dividends that are going to be paid between now and that future period. So like it or not, you're accepting a dividend risk in that investment. Now, that doesn't matter for the vast majority of people who are investing in that marketplace, because again, they're looking for the price action and the price momentum of that stock or security or call option, etc., that underlying asset. Right. But for those who are taking the other side of that transaction and trying to offer that, so such as investment banks and capital markets desks, it means a lot. Because that small little piece, that dividend piece, if it's unhedged, leaves them with a dirty hedge or a dirty exposure. And that's all fine and good as long as they aren't putting too much capital to work. But as that capital grows and grows and grows, they need to get rid of that risk. And so that's why they created the dividend swap market. So they could offer that risk or offset that risk. By selling that off to pensions, endowments, and other hedge fund environment. And really, that was the start of the dividend swap market, was to complete that triangle of spot price, future price, interest rates, which we already had. And then finally, the dividend in the middle, which was that dividend swap really completes that triangle and creates a perfectly hedged forward transaction. So now fast forward to structured product issuance. So now fast forward to structured product issuance. Again, they're in the business of issuing instruments and hedges and forward transactions on the market as a whole, on the price of the market. And then these dividends become kind of the byproduct or the scraps on the factory room floor that they're willing to sell off in order to continue their main line of business, which is creating structured products on the market as a whole. It's estimated that some $270 billion of structured products are issued every year just in Europe alone on the market, on the price. That leaves these banks with, again, a very small fraction of that in terms of dividend risk. The fees generated on that $270 billion are far in excess of whatever haircut that they'd be willing to take on their dividend risk. And again, that goes back to just the gross notional size of the structured product issuance versus the small notional size of the dividend swap or the dividend risk that they need to hedge in order to do more structured products. And that's kind of how we get into this oversupply of dividend swaps, which is a relatively small market versus the massive demand for structured product issuance, which can create this kind of supply demand imbalance in the dividend swap market. It's good for investors, obviously, and we believe it will continue far into the future. And even when it doesn't, again, you still have this, there is a risk to owning dividends. And so there will still be demand to sell off that risk again for the offset. And so that's kind of a fat tail event or other things like that. So we believe it's persistent and it will likely continue into the future.\n",

      " This is a great one, and it's actually, it defies a lot. I mean, the dividends versus buybacks. Should we really be paying out dividends and paying taxes on them and forcing other people to pay taxes on them? And yet we do. It's just societally, it's the way we do and have done things. There's a lot of merit to it. Even in the 80s when we saw tax rates in some states as high as 85%, we still saw dividends and dividend growth. I mentioned dividends have risen every single year except for three, even when we had massive buyback regime or kind of all those different regimes. But say the 90s, like late 90s, when if you were paying a dividend, you were an old fuddy-duddy and deserved to get any capital, right, and be changing your name to .com and forgetting about cash flows. That market, even we saw dividend growth in the S&P 500, but it was a lot more muted. It was like two to three. So even with a big buyback regime, we could still see. Pretty significant growth. To put some numbers to it, if you think on average, let's say right now we're at a 50% buyback, 50% growth or dividend payment on average kind of S&P 500. If we go to a 60% buyback, 40%, if it happens tomorrow, then we're going to see dividend cuts. If it happens over time as earnings are growing, which is generally what we're seeing, is those buybacks start to expand. They have to take over more of the cash flows. The dividend is still rising. They're just maybe not rising as it could. And then we see earnings cut. This is the nice thing. We see the buybacks get cut. The dividends are stable. And that's really what we've seen over time. We have a model to predict dividend growth and actually buyback to dividend ratio. Because the buybacks, you kind of have two bullets in the gun at that point. And if there's a problem on the horizon, a CEO or an executive or a board of directors, you can always just cut the buybacks. You'll know versus if you cut that dividend, you're taken out in shock.\n",

And it's agnostic to a lot of those different environments. Again, kind of hypothetically say we have our crystal ball and we know dividends are going to fall 10%. I still want to do the dividend swap with you. I still want to invest. You want to sell because you want to get rid of the risk for some reason so you can do more structured products because your boss is telling you you can't do anymore. So you need to get rid of the risk. So let's come together and agree on a price. Well, we're not going to pay 90. I'm not going to pay you 90 because I could rather buy a T-bill. And so something less than that. And just in case my crystal ball is a little fuzzy, I'll give you 87. And you'll say, OK, well, I really need to do this structured product and I'm going to get the dividend anyway. So why not? There's very little risk, right? So you trade for 87 and now I'm actually able to earn the difference. And so I'm earning that. And I'm not going to be able to sell it for 90. And so I'm going to be able to earn that dividend risk premium, which is this And that's really how that marketplace kind of exists in that regard on a regular basis. Now, had you already been an investor yesterday and now dividends had hypothetically gone down, then obviously there's going to be an adjustment period. Right where now all of a sudden the expectations are negative 10% add in the premium and now we said again earning that premium that different risk\n",

The market is pricing in more risk of something like that out five years than it is in one year. So we have some of that priced in. And then if there's just this, all of a sudden there's maybe a new regime. This one, I think, you know, pretty practical. And so I'm always thinking about, well, what's the catch? Come on, there's got to be. So a tax regime where they say from now on dividends are taxed at 100 percent. That would be a very bad thing for a product like this or an asset class like this, because now companies are going to really have to rank their overall dividend policy. I don't think they cut it to zero because they're still an endowment foundation type investors that care about the dividend, the cash flow. But now dividends get cut, let's say, 10 percent across the board. And so you'd see tomorrow just drop 10 percent across the board and then go back to that risk premium. That's a side thing.\n",

      " Yeah, it's the question I would ask myself. So it's perfect. It's different. Dividends, I mean, yes, they have the beta, but they're also different. And I can justify the differences. I mean, I was literally that kid in class who would ask, well, why? What do you mean MC squared? What if it's MC cubed? And the teachers would get so frustrated. So I love to ask this why, why, why, why, why, until I can finally get to, OK, that makes sense. I can justify that. And it has a beta of 0.3 because markets, as they rise, dividends also rise. So the two things work together. That's kind of like more toys are sold in colder climates. Not because toys get sold in colder climates. It's because Christmas is in a colder time of the year. So there is some definite correlation for sure, but it's not necessarily causation. So as we get sell-offs in markets, which is really what you should be most concerned about when you don't want them to correlate, does the sell-off result? Does it really impact Coca-Cola's dividend policy? Is the board of directors saying, geez, the market's going down today. Maybe we should cut our dividend. I think it's actually the opposite. So we see that most of the time we're seeing kind of rising dividends on a steady basis. As markets are just going through little hiccups, there's no change in the dividend policy of most of the S&P 500-ish companies. So we see a good stability and kind of stickiness to the downside. And then we just had that kind of one period where. Where we saw these massive declines. So then you just have to evaluate. Okay, so we're definitely going to have some correlation to the downside there. And had I bought the 30% equity market, 70 per T-bills, I would have probably had a pretty similar return profile had I just been invested here or the dividend swap market. So it kind of works along each of those different points along the way. And you kind of get the correlation when you want it and the non-correlation when you don't want it.\n",

      " First of all, the risk reducer concept, anytime you get into risk reducer land, you have a far larger burden of proof that you have to do as a wholesaler or as a product or something, right? Because now you're asking me to add a lot more money to this strategy, this oddball esoteric strategy that I don't know much about. And so I really need to do a lot more research on it. If it's a return enhancer, I can allocate a much smaller amount and still get the benefit if I'm right. It's the strategy. So now I have to do a lot more work. So is there leverage in this risk reducer strategy? That's a big question. In this case, we wanted to check that box no, and it effectively does. Because oftentimes, we see the risk reducer strategy that come to us are using leverage in some way, shape, or form. And you really have to understand the portfolio and what you're leveraging. And then what's the time frame? So here, we don't have a big time. Divi's, I mean, it's been around for a while now. So we've had time to bake it and really see in-market real dollars. Being active. Allocated. Redemptions. Creations. We've had all these different environments. We've had the Brexit. We got to watch it. And so now that's a blessing. On day one, it was a much more difficult product to understand. Get your brain around it and get to see it trade. So now at least we have some history. But it's not a huge history. So then the next step is, OK, now how do we go the next layer down? And understanding these dividends and really where they trade, how they trade, how often they trade. Who is the buyer on the other side? And vice versa. Who's the seller? And when does everything go wonky? When does it all go sideways? And so what's going to cause those buyers and sellers to break down their traditional relationship of this value proposition for us? So I think of it in those factors. And then obviously, the fundamental core of what do I think dividends are going to do? So if they're right, if this wholesaler is right, and he's telling me that this product is built and designed to be based on that dividend payment stream, somehow, some way, shape, or form, then I can generally come up with my own assessment on what I think dividends are going to do. There's a lot of good information out there. And we have a pretty robust set of research on our website, both the advisor's website as well as the ETF website. But if I can get comfortable with the dividends and I can understand, OK, the S&P dividends are probably going to fairly continue to grow as it, then I need to understand the trading environment and how that happens. Fortunately, now the futures trade. So anyone. Internet browser. Internet browser can go to the S&P's website and see where these dividend futures are priced and trading. That's great. We've got a lot more transparency now than he first started the product or a few years ago instead of the over-the-counter market, because they do really trade almost very subtle. So that's good. Check that box. Not using leverage. Continually, you know, like it's investing in an asset that I can kind of understand. And now it's a matter of where does it go sideways? How do these two market presents that have generally been stepping together day after day after day? Because one person needs to sell the risk and the other person needs to buy it. When do they change their mind? And that is going to be one when there's huge structural overhang, right? Which is going to cause kind of a reset, which is going to be a fantastic opportunity. And I'm going to want to know it, that it's an opportunity and not a breakdown of some fundamental thing. How do I get that information? Right? Because is the firm big enough to call me? Probably not. And so are they big enough to answer the phone when I want to talk to this structural or is this is this a mispricing or an anomaly? And then just kind of understanding a little bit more about the market. And that's really what I see of this as a product is it's going to have shifts. There's going to be moments when markets reprice things. We've even seen it just been alive in February of 2016. I think it was when we saw kind of this like shift in the curve, yet no shift in expectations for analysts, no shift in expected the economy and like that. And yet we saw the kind of flat. And so that was one of those great opportunities to enter and buy kind of like a good entry. Yeah. But then those are really few and far between about three years. So for the most part, it's type of a product. And I think, you know, you start allocating, but you just, you have to allocate a more meaningful amount. And this is what I would say. And I would argue myself is I have to allocate a more meaning out. Otherwise I'm just messing around, you know, it's, and I encourage, you know, usually people to mess around and try it and start to see and watch it and get used to it before they allocate bigger dollars to something like a risk reducer. But at the end of the day, you have to. And we've done a lot of work on say a 50 50 bond bond, you know, like bond divvy type allocation. And it pretty amazing. How I think that the ag had a standard deviation of around very low standard divvy has stand for so very low, like both of them. When you put them together, I think the state deviation went to 2.5, just awesome. I mean, that's like, like that's how portfolio allocation is supposed to work. And if you can do that with these kinds of assets, neat thing. It's.\n",

      " Sure. I guess maybe I'll take it back and work chronologically and how we, or I kind of came to A, where I am today, but also as an advisor, some of my different philosophies and investments. And being on the West Coast, a lot of the wealth that's created here is not capital markets wealth. It's more somebody built a business, somebody built a company structure, somebody was part of a company that sold, maybe they built a big real estate empire. So our clients at Morgan Stanley, I started in the mid nineties, kind of watched the big.com run up and lived through that. But the clients hated the capital markets. Why would I want to put all my wealth in the capital markets and modern portfolio theory? And for you to tell me that you were down 17% is not a victory. And when the market's down 18 and you don't get to pound your chest on that, that naturally lent itself to alternative investments and kind of creating an absolute return ish strategy for a client, knowing that I was going to be able to do this. And I was going to be able to do this. I would fail years in and years out. And the client knew that too, but at least we were trying to make a difference and to build a portfolio of different kinds of risks in that portfolio. And the clients could understand. And so in doing that, you, you had this almost like an evolution where you went from first saying, okay, well, let's do liquid alternatives because they're different. They can make a difference. But I found, you know, quickly really is, is they're just high price T-bills in a lot of cases. And, and at the end of the day, they're either over diversified and shouldn't really be in a liquid wrapper because maybe the real value was the use of leverage or some other aspect of it, or they just had a sexy name, but they didn't really have a sexy strategy. So really like learning how to dig. And I'm naturally, um, I kind of come from an engineering background and have that in my DNA. Like I was the kid who took apart the toaster when he was 11 years old. So I just really want to understand things. And so I would tear apart these different strategies and kind of understand, where the returns would likely come from and knowing that a lot of them were bogus hedge funds, private equity. Now there, there was something interesting there because you could have a lot more interesting strategies and our clients were a bit wealthier. They weren't billionaire type clients, but they had five to $500 million net worth. And so with that, we were able to use a lot of different unique strategies that had longer lockups and longer liquidity kind of provisions. And again, kind of wanting to understand everything that was in there and really understand the value proposition. It came to how do I allocate my assets? Do I allocate stocks, bonds, alternatives, or maybe my bond hedge fund isn't really a bond in a strategy and maybe it's not alternatives. What is alternative? That's a whole swath of things. So it came down to really what we're trying to do is just risk reducers and return enhancer. So a bond hedge fund, for example, that's highly levered is potentially a return enhancer, not a risk reduce or an equity. So I can't think of a hedge fund as maybe a risk reducer and not a return enhancer. So I can't think of them like stocks or bonds. And I can now break up the entire planet of investments into these two different buckets. And if I'm right, and sometimes that's the real trick is being right. What you think is a risk reducer may not be. It may be a risk enhancer and a return reducer, unfortunately. That is really kind of the premise and the philosophy that I arrived at and made a lot of mistakes. But we would allocate stocks and bonds. And I think that's a really good idea. We would allocate about 50 to 60% of our clients assets in alternatives by the traditional sense. And to us, it wasn't wild because it was really just allocating kind of a blended 60-40 between return enhancers, reducers, different wrappers.\n",

And it sounds like your first cut at exploring that space, creating a mental structure around it is that risk reducer, return enhancer mentality. But do you have a further mental map for how you go ahead and break down the landscape of alternatives that you like to use when you're thinking and evaluating a new alternative\n",

      " One of them is to then further to go, and we really, I enjoyed the alternative space because it was intellectually stimulating. There's a lot of engagement there and excitement as an advisor, but also as a storyteller, right? When you're trying to explain to your client how you add value or create value, understanding what these strategies do and did. So there's either strategies or there's assets. So bonds as an asset, a hedge fund that invests in convertible bonds might be a strategy or it might just be an asset class, right? We might be just getting ourselves exposed to the convert space, or maybe we're getting ourselves exposed to this manager and their unique style of managing a portfolio and that asset. So that was the kind of the next mental breakdown I had to do is, first of all, what are they trying to do? Are they trying to accomplish an objective that's a very steady, stable objective? And then second, are they trying to? Be the alpha generator, the creator of that return? And if so, then how do I put a score on that? And then if not, then are they just giving me this unique exposure or could I get that exposure myself? Again, kind of reverse engineering these portfolios and strategies, the options market, the derivatives market. There's a lot of opportunity there for an advisor who has sophisticated clients to do it without the manager. And so that was, again, kind of back to that evolution of that next layer down strategy. Versus assets. And sometimes both. I think most.\n",

      " that I've ever spoken to would consider 50% to 60% to be an astronomical amount to put a client's wealth in alternatives, not only because I think obviously the alternative space is non-transparent and can often be very hard for an advisor to grapple on their own, but because of those client behavioral issues that they're non-transparent investment strategies very often, and they have a large degree of tracking error to those traditional asset classes like equities and bonds that they're going to be familiar with from seeing the S&P 500 reported daily and then not having that mark to their portfolio. Can you comment on the way you thought about managing client behavior, having such a large allocation to alternatives in your portfolios?\n",

      "******\n",
      " Yeah, it's interesting too because, again, it kind of has to be an evolution where then the conviction has to be there. And I think as most advisors, myself included, you start with 2% allocation and then you're left with the riskiest of the alternatives because otherwise you're never going to get the payoff. You have to have some massive asymmetry and you start to get a stigma of alternatives. Those are high risk. But in reality, if you're allocating strategies that are designed to produce 5% to 7% returns on average over time with a very low standard deviation, you can't necessarily allocate just 2% or 3% to that because when the market sells off and your 60-40 portfolio blows up, it didn't help at all. So you have to have a more meaningful allocation there. So that's step one is, hey, what are we trying to do? Are we trying to just be with the market? And if so, then you're going to be. Pissed at me when the market blows up because you say it now that you're comfortable with that. And yet when the market does blow up, you're going to be upset. But if we're trying to actually be different than the market, then we have to invest differently. And so that was the first thing is getting them with that. And then the second is understanding that these strategies, really understanding them and getting to the bottom of them and knowing who these managers are and knowing what their risk limit and their leverage limits and all of where is the real return coming from? Like merger arb is a great example. There's about 350 to 400 deals announced every year. The typical merger arb manager will invest in all of them. They'll earn about 300 basis points of spread on average of that kind of risk that they're offering. And they'll lever it up massively and earn a decent return until it blows up as an overall strategy. But there were certain managers who really focused on no leverage, finding the deals that are going to go and actually shorting the deals that are most likely to break. But the market's not pricing it in because of that. It's just inefficient. So there were these little opportunities where you could genuinely add value. And the clients loved that. They loved that you were investing their assets in something that was trying to make a difference, not always going to win, but at least somewhat understandable in how it worked. And if you could articulate that value to the client, then I think it worked well for us. In fact, we won a lot of business just as an advisor. Certainly like investing in 08 during the big housing crisis. That was amazing. We were short subprime through a lot of different managers. And it was like the best time ever. And the world was melting down and we were winning month after month after month. So that was kind of a need.\n",

Today I am speaking with Jack Vogel, co-CIO of boutique ETF issuer Alpha Architect. I've known Jack for some time now and was particularly excited to bring him on the show for two reasons. The first, which you will quickly learn about, is that he's a very smart guy. He's a very smart guy, and he's a very smart learn in the episode is his near encyclopedic knowledge of investing literature. I've met few investors who have both the breadth and depth of recall that he does for both academic and practitioner studies. The second was because he helps manage a momentum strategy. Almost every investor has, at one time or another, at least perused the pages of Graham's Intelligent Investor and value investing is considered by most to be as wholesome as Warren Buffett drinking a Coca-Cola while eating apple pie. Momentum, on the other hand, is often disregarded as performance-chasing nonsense with little foundation in the realm of real investing. Yet, as you'll find in our conversation, deep care and thought goes into both understanding the anomaly itself and constructing a portfolio that can efficiently attempt to capture it. I hope you enjoy my conversation with Jack Vogel. Jack, thank you for joining me today.\n",

Why aren't there more momentum strategies available to investors?\n",

      " I mean, probably a lot of it's just driven by the way people have historically categorized strategies into different boxes or buckets of a portfolio. Not sure exactly why that happened. So if you go on like Morningstar's Stylebox or Vanguard or iShares, all those websites are going to show you generally two dimensions. They're going to show you size, right? So small to large, and then value to growth, right? Along those two dimensions. And so, you know, a lot of people will try to pick it to the extent you're not just picking the market. You know, they want to allocate somewhere along those two dimensions. So momentum to some people, I think, is thought of as a growth strategy. You know, there is not a massive actually overlap with growth. But I think for some people, since, you know, the way buckets have been created, this is just my experience. I think people, you know, kind of seem to bucket people into value or growth. And unless you want to add a third dimension, and now all of a sudden people are trying to figure out where you fit on the three-dimensional style box. You know, I think that's probably the reason. Just the original way people were assessing funds along the value growth spectrum.\n",

      " So let's stay along this vein of thinking of momentum versus growth. Our friends over at O'Shaughnessy Asset Management recently published a piece called Factors from Scratch. I know you've read it. And it looks at breaking down the returns of different factor strategies into the components of fundamental growth and revaluation that occurs. And what they end up finding for the momentum factor is that a really significant portion of the total return can actually be explained by accelerating earnings growth in the underlying securities that are held by the portfolio. And they go so far as to call momentum growth done right. So to me, it seems like there is an argument that momentum might actually be a growth strategy. Now, they also point out that after about a year, that growth rate tapers off in the portfolio and there's a there's a reversion back to the market rate. And there might be an anomaly explanation here where the market's extrapolating in error at the growth rate of these securities going forward. But it does seem to me like there is the potential for some overlap of momentum versus growth. And it sounds like you're arguing that you actually don't think there is significant overlap. So I was wondering if you could draw apart the distinction for me.\n",
      "投资组合的增长趋势与投资组合的增长趋势相反,O'Shaughnessy Asset Management最近发表了一篇名为从头开始的因素(Factors from Scratch)的文章,该文章将投资组合的增长趋势分为基本增长和重估的组成部分,并指出投资组合的增长趋势在一年后会逐渐缩小,这将导致投资组合的增长趋势出现异常,这将导致投资组合的增长趋势在未来增长\n",
      "******\n",
      "******\n",
      " Yeah, I mean, so what I would say about that is that clearly, I mean, I would never just allocate a portion of my portfolio probably to a pure growth strategy. So to the extent they're saying, hey, momentum is a better way to gain access towards a growth type strategy, that makes sense. And again, I think just nuanced data definition. And again, that is actually a great piece by the O'Shaughnessy guys. I recommend everyone read that. But so what they find in there, especially on momentum, right, is actually something that was in one of Robert Novy-Marx's paper. Fundamentally, momentum is fundamental momentum, right? And so what Novy-Marx finds as well as the O'Shaughnessy guys find is that at some level, the fact that momentum returns can be explained by like fundamental momentum, meaning an earnings type of momentum. And so at some level, you know, if you're defining growth as the growth of earnings, well, yeah, I mean, that makes sense because momentum, we already know just from the literature, it's been shown that growth rates and earnings are highly related to price momentum strategies, right? So Robert Novy-Marx's paper will look at that. And basically now in his paper, he'll say, hey, earnings momentum is better than price momentum. And we discuss that in our book. But. You know why we still use price momentum. But at a high level, it actually gives you a little bit more confidence that, you know, momentum is not just this hole in the wall idea. You're just picking stocks with high price returns. It's actually you're picking stocks with high price returns. That's what we do. But fundamentally behind that, a reason that, you know, these winner stocks on a price basis are doing well is because they have good earnings momentum. And one of the reasons that these loser stocks on a price basis have. Low momentum is because their earnings are going down. So, you know, to the extent we're talking about growth from an earnings perspective. Yeah. Momentum is a decent way to gain access to a growth type strategy. Yeah.\n",

How do you look at establishing your confidence in continuing to use something like price momentum in your investment process in the face of contradictory pressures?\n",

      " Well, let's first just maybe talk about the Novi Marks paper a little bit more. So on the Novi Marks paper, what he tests specifically is he looks at a price momentum strategy, which I think everyone understands. But if not, it's pretty simple. You just look at stocks based on their past one-year return, exclude last month. And you go long a winner bucket. You go short a loser bucket. So high level, that's the momentum factor. And again, it's always in the context of a long, short portfolio. And then he compares that to what he calls fundamental momentum. And he measures fundamental momentum two ways. One is through looking at earnings announcement returns around earnings statements. And you look at the cumulative abnormal return. You sort stocks into those with the highest cumulative abnormal returns. That's your winner bucket. You short the ones with the lowest. Similarly. He does the same with standardized unexpected earnings, which is an older measure in the accounting literature. And what he finds is when you examine these long, short portfolios, you're right. The fundamental momentum strategy subsumes price momentum. So you're like, OK, Jack, well, clearly this is what it says in the paper. I'm not going to say he's wrong. So why do you still use price momentum? Well, there's two reasons. So one is the fact that. In his paper, what he does is and this is kind of standard in academic paper. He basically says, hey, I'm going to vol adjust these strategies to make them the same. Right. And so what vol adjusts, let's just say you want to have the same standard deviation of the portfolio returns. Well, what happens actually is price momentum happens to have a volatility around, let's say, 18, 19 percent. Right. Standard deviation of returns. So you're going to have a volatility around the long, short portfolio. Your earnings momentum portfolios, which, again, remember, are looking at earnings, which are fundamental. So in general, if you can imagine as the economy goes up or goes down, your high and low should still kind of go up and down, whereas price can be all over the place. Now, the standard deviation on these price portfolios is literally six percent. And so what that means is you either have to take the price momentum long, short portfolio. And cut it in a third. Or you need to 3X lever the long book of the fundamental portfolio and 3X lever the short book of the fundamental portfolio. And as you know, leverage is a double edged sword. So if you do the 3X one, yes, it's still it will subsume price momentum, but you also will go bankrupt. Right. And if you do a third, well, that's fine. But now you got two thirds of your bucket that you're assuming is in cash. Right. Right. That's one reason that that it's good to know that, you know, price momentum is kind of driven by fundamentals. But at the same time, I think that's examined in a long, short context. And if you ask me right now and said, Jack, I want you to run me a long, short momentum portfolio, I would actually probably do it with fundamental momentum. So Novi Marx's findings in there are good. And I wouldn't disagree with anything that he says in there. I would just say when building an investment. I don't necessarily have to follow that because that's not the goal of my portfolio.\n",

      " Yeah. So how about this? I'll just go through the process and then we can dig into each of the steps. So first step is kind of just assess what's our investable universe. So for investable universe, it's mainly mid-large caps in the US or international securities. The second step is, as I just mentioned, we are fans of price momentum, not fundamental. There's nothing wrong with fundamental, but we use price momentum. One of the reasons we use this, just getting back to that Novi Marx paper, is actually because a price momentum strategy has a lower correlation to a value strategy than a fundamental momentum strategy. So we use price momentum to get down to the top 10% top decile of securities. We use past year returns, price basis, or total return, excluding last month. So in step one, let's just do simple math. We start with 1,000 securities. Step two, we go to 100. Step three, what we do is we use what's called our frog in the pan measure. And this measure is similar to a low vol measure. And we take the top 50 or so stocks on this measure. So we go from 1,000 in step one to 100 in step two to 50 in step three. And then in step four, what we do is we try to time our rebalances some what are called seasonal effects in the momentum anomaly. And so we rebalance right before quarter ending months. So we rebalance our portfolios every quarter. And then the last step is, you know, we equal weight across securities. And so those are the five steps, you know, you end up with a 50 stock portfolio that gets rebalanced every quarter.\n",

      " So let me start with maybe a somewhat obvious question, which is a very common critique of momentum is that the anomaly just cannot survive real world trading costs, particularly after taxes. So what makes you think that you can run this strategy such that after transaction costs and after taxes, you still have the opportunity to capture some of the potential available alpha?\n",
      "让我想起一个很明显的问题:对动力的一种非常常见的批评是,异常不能在现实世界的交易成本中生存下来,特别是在税后所以,什么让你认为你可以运行这种策略,使交易成本和税后,你仍然有机会捕捉一些潜在的可用的阿尔法?\n",
      "******\n",
      "******\n",
      " Yeah, so that's a great question. And it's one that anyone who wants to do factor investing should probably understand. And so what I'd say is there's two questions there. One is taxes, one are trading costs. So first on taxes, one of the main reasons we preferred the ETF wrapper relative to a mutual fund wrapper is the fact that it is generally more tax efficient than a mutual fund. So for example, you can just, we'll talk about other people's momentum ETFs to stay high and to the right. So you can examine like MTUM or PDP, other momentum ETFs are out there that are not ours. And if you notice, they have rebalance every quarter, every six months in a general upward market, and you see that they have zero capital gain distribution. So on the tax front, the momentum wrapper definitely helps. And that's why we did that. Now, getting into the tax front, we're going to talk about the tax front. So we're going to talk into the transaction cost analysis. Definitely true that the more you trade, the higher the transaction costs will be, which means the higher the hurdle, the original alpha or expected return needs to be above the market. And so there's a couple of papers on this. I would say there's two strands of literature that attempt to examine whether or not factor investing, including momentum exceeds trading costs. One is the fact that the tax front is higher than the original alpha. And so there's a couple of papers on this. I would say there's a couple of papers on this. I would say One is the microstructure literature. And this would be going back in time, you know, the SACA paper, Novy-Mars paper. So there's a couple papers, Lesman, Shilzow, right? And so these papers basically make assumptions on using what's called the TAC data from academic sources on how much it costs to trade. And basically their high level takeaway from the academics is, hey, these things don't survive after a while. And so they're going to make assumptions on how much it costs to trade. And so they're going to make assumptions on how much it costs to trade. And so they're going to make costs to trade. And so they're going to make assumptions on how much it costs to trade. And then you have two other papers. One is by AQR, one is by BlackRock. So people who are, you know, highly skeptical will say, hey, these are clearly conflicted people, right? And I'd argue, hey, at a high level, neither of those firms would ever want to put their reputation at stake and give out bad information. But what they find is they say, hey, using our data, our trading data, which is how an actual institutional investor is going to trade, they're going to be able to trade at a higher level. And so they find that they work. So clearly you get this divergence in the microstructure literature that academics say it doesn't work, practitioners say it does. And I think a cool finding really is that if you examine, and this is in the AQR paper, they say, hey, let's just say how much it costs to S&P 500. And they use the academic data, the way that their model works. And according to the academics, you know, it would cost at least 60 basis points. To trade the S&P 500. That means literally for Vanguard to buy S&P 500 stocks, according to the academics, it's 60 bps. Whereas the practitioners have it as at like six bps, right? And then you ask Vanguard and iShares, and they're like, yeah, it's like eight to 10 bps, right? So clearly the academics model looks to be misspecified on a multiple of 10 times what the actual practitioners are doing. So, you know, I, I argue, you know, I wrote a long piece on it. I think people should read it to make sure you understand both sides of the story. But according to the microstructure literature, there's definitely a divergence. And then similarly, people have examined it from another way, which is try to infer trading costs. And I would say those papers clearly, once again, say it doesn't work. I have a pretty good rebuttal that I haven't seen anyone be able to actually say I'm wrong, that it doesn't work. There's some massive assumptions that are being made in this inferred trading costs literature, basically that everyone's running a perfect factor portfolio, which literally no one's doing. And when you make some real world assumptions, like there's some closet indexing, or in the past, potentially managers switch strategies, that that finding goes away. So I would say that the factor anomalies should work after trading costs. But what I would say is that there's, clearly a size limit, right? If you gave us like Warren Buffett with multiple 100 billions can't run a momentum strategy. That is a true fact. So I just recommend everyone kind of read about it. And you know, we tried to outline both sides of it. We still think it works. So is high level takeaway.\n",

But you also mentioned the fact that nobody really runs pure factor strategies. If you look at the marketplace of the very limited momentum offerings out there, you have some indices that are using a blend of different momentum measures. You have some that are taking into account fundamental momentum scores. You have some that are taking into account things like short interest, earning surprise, some that are using residual momentum. You guys use the very standard academic 12 minus one, but then employ things like frog in the pan, which we'll get to, as well as some seasonality in your rebalancing.

So you're like, hey, Jack, what's the limit for momentum? It's like, okay, well, as of right now, you know, I can kind of examine and, you know, if you look at the practitioner data, right, you know, they say it's like 50 plus billion. And so you'd be like, okay, well, that makes sense. But, you know, implicitly, there's also other strategies that are potentially doing non-momentum strategies, right? And so to the extent, you know, other people are kind of canceling it out, that does have an effect. Now, what I'd say is right now, it's probably, you know, depending on the way you form the portfolio, each one will have a different answer. Before. Before your trading costs will then potentially get higher and, you know, have an effect. Unfortunately, there's no great, perfect answer to that because it's going to adjust also over time. Like in five years, if the markets double, my answer right now would be you'd have to double that, right? Or if people are, for some reason, implicitly decided to move against the momentum strategy, maybe you have a little bit more capacity. So unfortunately, I don't know if I can give you like a perfect number, perfect answer. What I'd say, though, is that it's probably in, depending on who you believe, practitioners or academics, you get massive variance in what the capacity is, right? Like if we look at the BlackRock paper, right? If they're basically like saying, hey, we can do momentum, but we can trade over five days, like their capacity is literally $324 billion. Right.

      " I appreciate that. So I want to return back to something you mentioned really off the cuff earlier, but it was about your use of price momentum. And you mentioned that one of the reasons you like price momentum is that it offers a lower correlation to a strategy like value. And this is actually in line with the conversation I've had with you in the past, as well as with your co-CIO Wes, in talking about sector constraints within a momentum strategy. And so there's a lot of new literature in the last decade about the role of applying different constraints within a factor portfolio. And the evidence seems to suggest, at least as of today, that when you look at something like momentum, taking an unconstrained approach tends to maximize your compound annualized growth rate. But if you constrain yourself to be sector neutral to the overall market, you tend to maximize your information ratio. And so there was a paper from Hartford that I just recently read that suggested that you give up about 5% of your total return opportunity, but decrease your volatility by about 20% your tracking error when you go sector constrained. But I've heard you argue in the past is a long winded way of getting to my question. I've heard you argue in the past that that benefit really isn't as large when you consider it in the context of the market. And I think that's a really good question. And I think that's a really good question. And I think that's a really good question. And I think that's a really good question. Sort of on the efficient frontier, that if you go sector unconstrained and consider an unconstrained strategy in the context of other things in the portfolio, a lot of that tends to cancel out and or is actually beneficial diversification. So I was wondering if you could expand upon that idea a bit for me.\n",

      " There's probably two things in there. One is, yeah, we use price momentum because as I mentioned earlier, fundamental momentum, not surprisingly, since it's fundamental, has a higher correlation to value investing, which happens to be fundamental based, right? So that's why we use price momentum. And then you're right. As we've discussed in the past, we prefer unconstrained because what that kind of does is from a portfolio context, value and momentum, in general, people look at that long-short portfolio correlations between those two factors and you find that they're negatively correlated, again, in the long-short context. But even long only, they have a much lower correlation than just the broad market. And so we prefer to just allow the unconstrained momentum to work. And yeah, potentially, you're just going to have to do a lot of work. You're taking on some additional sector bets. But for us, I think it washes out from a portfolio context. And now, one side note that I would like to make about that one paper you mentioned is just you always have to remember that things are like the momentum anomaly, even in that Hartford piece, which actually is very educational and good, not criticizing at all.

And so the original paper was, you know, frog in the pan. And so the whole idea, though, was this is a paper got published in Review of Financial Studies, which is, you know, one of the top three academic finance journals. And what they were doing in the paper was they were trying to figure out if they could better explain the momentum anomaly. Right. And how they did that was they wanted to look at whether or not people were potentially, you know, I would say underreacting to certain information. Right. And so how they measure and why does frog in the pan come in? So frog in the pan comes in. And as people know, so, you know, the story is if you put a frog into a boiling hot pan of water, the frog will just jump right out. Right. Whereas if you put the frog into a, you know, cold cup of water on a stove and then slowly heat it up, the frog will probably just unfortunately stay in there until its unfortunate death. And so neat title for a paper. Definitely catchy. But the results are also cool. You know, what they find is that basically. They examine two types of momentum. And so I'll give you the example. You've probably heard me give it a million times, but it's good for the listeners. So imagine you have two types of firms with high momentum. One is I'll call it boring big box. Right. And boring big box is up 100 percent. So it's classified as a high momentum firm. And how it got its momentum is it was up 50 basis points for 200 straight days. Right. Whereas we have another firm and it's called exciting biotech. And exciting biotech was bouncing around at zero, you know, going up and down every day. And then two months ago, it got FDA approval for its new drug. And on that day, it went up 100 percent. So both these firms have 100 percent momentum, yet they've achieved their high momentum in completely different ways. Right. Boring big box was kind of slow moving, grinding up. Exciting biotech had very fundamental in your face. And so what the authors hypothesized is that the momentum premium, both on the long and short leg, is probably driven by these boring big box type stores where people are kind of underreacting to information that's slowly dripping out about the firm. Whereas the firms that have, you know, these kind of in your face news events, people may, you know, accurately price them when the news comes out. Right. And so the way they measured it. It's just, you know, the percentage of positive or negative trading days over the past year. And so for your long book, you want to have firms that have a higher percentage of positive, i.e. These are ones that are probably high momentum, but the momentum is like a slower grind. And what the papers find is that basically the majority, if not all of the momentum anomaly, is driven by these boring big box type stores, momentum firms. And so we use that to filter down. Our top hundred into our top 50. And that's the measure that we use in our index.\n",

And one of the arguments is just quite simply that if you don't adjust for relative volatility or beta, a lot of your higher risk securities, risk you're being measured by volatility, will end up in the top and bottom deciles of momentum simply due to the magnitude of their volatility.

      " So the signal part, I guess, is only part of the equation, though. I use this really hokey analogy that building a portfolio is a lot like cooking. You have your ingredients and then you have your recipe. And as an industry, we spend a lot of time talking about the ingredients. Do you use 12 minus one momentum? Do you use fundamental momentum? All the things that go into it. But there is the transformation of that information that is necessary to ultimately create a portfolio. Where a lot of firms will deviate in process. So some firms might take that momentum information and just tilt their market cap weights. Others might choose the top 33% and wait based on the strength of the signal. Some stay sector neutral. Some don't. We touched upon that in a prior question. Talk to me how you think about the actual portfolio construction. I know you use an equal weight methodology. Why? Did you guys elect equal weight versus the infinite number of other variations that you could consider?\n",

      " That's a great question. So, you know, how do we get into the final end solution? So I would say there's probably, you know, let me go through three things there. So one is, and actually this was found in that, you know, Hartford-Himco paper that you mentioned. One is the fact that, you know, momentum historically has generally worked better in deciles relative to quintiles, i.e. more extremes, right? And so, well, one of the takeaways from that is, you know, and how we, XANI, wanted to build our portfolio is we wanted to potentially have a lot more concentration to the momentum factor. So, you know, at the outset, you know, that's why we go directly to the top decile and then within there pick what we think are the top 40 to 50 names. And so by doing that, we are, you know, giving more concentration to this factor, I would say, relative to most of the momentum. So, you know, we're not going to be able to do that. We're going to be able to do that. We're going to be able to do that. We're going to be able to in the industry. And so that was one thing that we definitely wanted to focus on was the concentration aspect. That is like a point of differentiation, I believe. The second thing, and you kind of were asking, you know, why do we equal weight? Well, you know, one of the pros and cons of concentration is you get a concentrated portfolio. Let's say it's, you know, 40 stocks or 50 stocks. Well, now market cap weighting becomes potentially, potentially going to be a lot more concentrated. So, you know, we're going to be able to have an issue where let's say, you know, you run the screens and we have 45 mid cap stocks, and then we throw in Apple, Google, and Amazon, just picking biggest names I can think of, maybe a Microsoft, right? So we got 35 mid caps and like four stocks that are massive. Well, if we market cap weight, well, now we're all of a sudden with no restrictions, we're now basically a fund that holds four stocks and 35 mid caps, right? And four stocks are going to completely drive the portfolio. So equal weighting is good from two perspectives. What it allows us to do is, you know, take a, you know, equal bet across the, the 50 names, 40 to 50 names that we invest in, as well as, so you get some, you know, so, so when equal weighting, you get, I would say some sort of risk control embedded. And then the second aspect is to the extent you think that size has any effect at all, it will generally, it will generally tilt you towards more mid caps relative to just other funds that are using market cap weighting.\n",

      " Yeah. So I recommend everyone listening reads Corey's piece on seasonality, which was really good. Found it pretty good. Now, how do we get into seasonality in the context of momentum and why does it matter? So when I was working with Wes as a PhD student, we actually were kind of like, hey, I wonder if momentum is driven by flows in certain quarters. Because as many people know, institutions, as well as mutual funds, need to disclose their holdings at the end of every quarter. And there is a separate set of literature that looks at kind of how managers will do what's called window dressing. And what they'll do, what the research has found is that managers will essentially at the end of the quarter, let's say you're like a deep value. Investor and that you're actually doing it right. And it was a horrible quarter. Right. Just because value got beat up. And that happens all the time. And, you know, basically what the literature found was that managers will what's called window dress their portfolio to make the names at the quarter end look better than they probably were. So what would happen there is let's say your momentum portfolio is down and you're afraid of crap. Now. I got to show my holdings and explain to my shareholders why I'm doing poorly. Well, one thing you could do is just be stick it out and be like, hey, sticking to my process, not changing. Another thing you could do is you could say, hey, you know what, let's just for like one day add in some like Apple and Amazon because those are like some good names that people want to say. Right. And the literature found that managers do this. And actually the literature has also found that managers do this and they actually benefit from it. And how they measure it. And the literature that was will an investor stick with a fund that's down if it has good names in it or bad names. And actually, if you put the good names in, people will stick with you. So there's literally like benefits in investor behavior, why people would do this. So given that West and I were like, hey, maybe momentum works well in these quarter ending months, mainly because people are going to be like selling their losers, especially in December, but selling their losers and then buying winners. And what we found was that. It's generally a fact that quarter ending months are generally the best month to run a long, short momentum portfolio. December is definitely the best because not only is there a potential window addressing, there's tax loss selling. And well, what happens in tax loss selling? You're going to sell all your losers and you're going to hold on to your winners. So what does that mean? Low momentum stocks are going to keep going down because people are going to be selling high momentum stocks. People are not going to rebalance until Jan one. So there's going to be literally less selling. Pressure there, which could increase their prices. And so as a way to take advantage of this known fact. So West and I, at the outset, we were like, yeah, we have an APUB paper, you know, and then we found out that this paper was published in Financial Review, which is like, I would say, like lower tier journal. So, you know, we basically just replicated something that was already out there. But we were like, hey, let's take advantage of this in our strategy because it seems to be systematic. And so what we do is we now rebalance our momentum for firms into the high momentum stocks basically a month before right at the beginning of the quarter ending months in a way to potentially front run. If this behavior exists, people buying up the high momentum firms.\n",

      " As a quant, it always just strikes me as a very weird concept. I know the literature has proven out that this window dressing exists, but as a quant, it's just such a foreign concept of window dressing. But it does seem to be a truly powerful anomaly and something that can potentially be exploited if systematically played. So switching gears here a bit. The momentum strategy can be a bit of a chameleon at times. I actually recently had a conversation with a manager who mentioned to me that if you were to look at their portfolio's current factor characteristics, they would actually load very strongly on your traditional 12-1 momentum. And I actually pulled up their current holdings in your wonderful free tool set that you guys offer. And it was true that compared to the market, they loaded very heavily on 12-1, despite the fact that 12-1 was not, at all, a part of their process. And they simply argued that, you know, what had happened was the securities they picked in their process ended up being the ones that had done very well recently. And so the momentum factor had actually, in many ways, turned into their portfolio, which was more of a quality growth portfolio, a bit of an anomaly there. But I wanted to address this concept of, we often think of style drift as being a very bad thing. But in many ways, you know, momentum is a chameleon. It can look like many different styles and really whatever style is in favor. I wanted to get your thoughts about the style drift of momentum. And is it a feature? Is it a bug?

      " Yeah, so I think what investors should do is understand, especially because generally, you know, not everyone runs like a stock strategy. So to the extent you're trying to access it through like an ETF or a mutual fund, you probably just want to understand, you know, if there is a solid, because as you mentioned, you know, some people may have industry constraints. Some people may not. Some people may try to be sector neutral, et cetera. So I don't think it's a bug whatsoever, to be quite honest with you. I think it's actually like a benefit of momentum, meaning, you know, like just take the classic like internet bubble, right? And then the crash thereafter. So in the internet bubble, what did you want to do? You would have wanted to be long all these stocks that were just trading at insane prices and you kind of knew they were, but trying to time when that factor is going to work, when it's not going to work. I've just... I've just given up. Like literally, I've given up. And so a neat aspect is, hey, if you were running a momentum strategy going into the internet bubble, that would have been great because you would have been in all the dot com names. But then what happens in the crash thereafter is actually, I think, just as equally important and just as interesting, right? So what is momentum doing? It literally is kind of... It's almost like just close your eyes, pick the firms that have done the best over the past year. Sounds kind of crazy, but not... Not that crazy. So when the dot com bubble is coming crashing down, what's going to happen? Well, if you're doing it systematically every quarter, every month, what's going to happen? Once the stocks are going down, you're going to be like, hey, maybe some of these old school economy industrial firms that are up 5% literally because their price is nothing but their dividends 5%, you would have went into those firms in the crash thereafter.

Even that new article that we kind of discuss, you're like, hey, you know, deciles do better than quintiles. Concentration works well. Totally. You can't you can't argue with the data. Right. Data is what data is. Makes sense. Probably makes sense for a lot of reasons. But one of the downsides is that, well, the minute you start taking on a more concentrated portfolio, you're going to have a lot more tracking error relative to an index. And, you know, I think we have now kind of. Tried to educate potential people in our strategy, as well as just everyone who's just trying to learn about, you know, different types of factor investing, that there's definitely a pro con aspect of factor investing where generally concentration in the past. And if I had to guess, again, I can't predict, but if I had to guess in the future, concentration generally led to higher returns in the past. But it led to higher. Tracking error. And so to the extent you're investing in these strategies, you just want to make sure you understand that if you are a person that's going to literally open your statement and be like, oh, man, last quarter, my momentum fund just lost to the index by five percent. What's going on? The process is broken. You're literally never going to be successful in it. And in that case, you're probably better off doing like a closet index type momentum strategy.

So one would be, you know, clearly you want to be reading the new research, just understanding what's going on. And, you know, even the old research as well, just to make sure you have a full grasp on it. We have like, for example, with our value strategy, even for momentum, you know, we've tested a couple additions to see whether or not, you know, that they would have added any value. And maybe sometimes they've been marginal, but again, nothing like statistically significant. So I think two things would have to be true for us to make a change. One is it probably either have to be highly statistically significant, meaning that, you know, by adding this, you know, the two streams are definitely different, definitely adds value. Or it would just have to be. It would probably be something that is, you know, maybe a small tweak that probably could add value over the long term and makes just economic sense or sense from an asset construction standpoint. So clearly the research plays a part. And then the second part is obviously to the extent we were allocated a lot more capital, potentially we'd have to, you know, adjust our strategy. So, you know, if we had a billion in momentum, I think it'd probably be slightly different, not vastly different, but definitely be slightly different than, how we're managing, you know, a hundred million in momentum.\n",

There's actually numerous papers now kind of saying, looking back and trying to re-replicate all of these strategies that were published in top tier journals and therefore, you know, notified as anomalous, right? And so I think in defense of the academic community here, I think they're kind of getting a bad rap because some people from the outside are like, hey, these academics are just like data mining. Like, what are they doing here? Should we even trust them? I don't think that's necessarily what they're doing.

No. What I would say, though, is that going forward, you know, you want to make sure you understand why an anomaly exists and whether or not it's easily arbitraged. And if it is. Such as that.

      " So maybe we can talk about that why for a minute, because so much of the quantitative finance space is based on this idea that we are evidence-based to the best of our ability, that we're looking back at historical returns and we're trying to identify robust anomalies. But again, pointing out the fact that this is an observational science, we can't run repeated trials. And to the best of our efforts, we can look for evidence in different geographies, time horizons, and asset classes to support our hypothesis. At the end of the day, we are all scouring the same data. And so there are the risks of data mining. And so very often the proposition is, well, that's all necessary, but not sufficient, that you do need a why. And to me, often that why an anomaly exists. Is somewhat hypothetical. It's not necessarily proven out in the data that we're speculating. And it does, to a certain degree, contain a faith-based element that it'll continue going forward, that we have this explanation we believe in, and we believe it'll continue going forward. I was wondering if you could touch upon that a bit. How do you think about the balance of data versus the qualitative why as to how an anomaly exists? And what changes? What changes your mind as to whether the why is sufficient for you to use an anomaly going forward?\n",
      "量化金融领域主要以证据为基础,以尽量利用证据来支持我们的假设我们尽可能地根据证据来分析数据,以此来评估历史收益率,并试图识别出强有力的异常但是,我们不能重复进行实验,我们需要观察科学,所以我们可以在不同地理区域时间范围和资产类别中寻找证据来支持我们的假设最终,我们都在搜索相同的数据,因此数据挖掘的风险存在所以,我们常常会说,这都是必要的,但不够的,你需要做一个分析,为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析为什么需要一个分析?为什么需要一个分析?为什么需要一个分析?\n",

      " Yeah, so I think I've kind of come almost full circle on this, right? And full circle meaning when you start anything in finance, especially a PhD program, one of the first things you learn is, hey, markets are efficient, right? And what does that mean? That means that people aren't idiots. On average, you're going to see that if you invest in a particular type of securities and you expect or hope to earn a higher return than another set of securities, you should be implicitly taking on some sort of an additional risk, right? Now, I think one of the things that's hard to say is, hey, what is that risk, right? That's never really defined. It just says, you know, in the efficient market hypothesis is that if you get higher returns, you must have invested in a more risky investment, right? And so then, you know, obviously, as shown in the literature, you know, there's like value, size, anomalies that appear, right? And finally, French would say, hey, these are just riskier investments. But then there's some very valid behavioral reasons that potentially people are, you know, overreacting to news for value, underreacting to news for momentum, right? And so you're like, hey, well, maybe it's behavioral and maybe people are just idiots and these things will work forever in the future. And I think it's a combination. And I think that's the kind of both there probably should be some behavioral error that people are, for some reason, systematically making. But the additional aspect is that for something really to work in the future, it has to have some sort of an additional risk. And so, again, I've kind of come full circle on that. I think markets are somewhat efficient, not perfectly efficient. I think most people would agree with that. And so, you know, like value is an example where, potentially people are overreacting to news, causing prices to go lower. But also value stocks may just literally be inherently more risky, right? So we use enterprise multiple. Right now that's consumer discretionary. There's like a legit risk that Amazon is going to put every one of those consumer discretionary companies out of business. So what I'd say is I think going forward, if you're trying to do any sort of factor investing, you kind of want to know why. And the why should be at some level. It should be a little bit riskier or there should be some systematic behavioral error that people are making now and that you expect them to continue to make in the future.\n",
      "市场是有效的,对吗?这意味着人们不是白痴平均而言,你会看到,如果你投资某种类型的证券,并期望或希望获得比其他证券的回报更高,你应该明显地承担某种额外的风险,对吗?现在,我认为你试图说的第一件事是,你可能知道,这是风险的价值,对吗?那是永远没有定义的它说,你知道,在未来高效市场假设中,如果你得到更高的回报,你已经投资了更多的股票,对吧?嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿,嘿\n",

      " So we're going to spend a lot of time talking about momentum today. And momentum is one of those anomalies that very often the reason that gets ascribed to its existence is a behavioral error, that there is investor anchoring that causes initial underreaction, potentially an argument about rational inattention of investors. And then eventually, once momentum takes hold, that there's a hurting and an overreaction effect. But I very rarely hear a risk-based argument for momentum. It's almost always a behavioral argument. With you coming somewhat full circle back to the idea that there should be a risk-based argument for an anomaly going forward, where do you think the risk-based argument lies for momentum?\n",
      "动量是那些异常之一,其存在的原因通常是行为错误,投资者锚定会导致最初的低反应,可能导致投资者不注意的合理论点最终,一旦动量产生了影响,就会产生伤害和过度反应但是我很少听到基于动量的风险论点这几乎总是行为论点\n",
      "******\n",
      "******\n",
      " Well, so again, coming full circle, I think it's got to be one of the two, risk or behavior, right? So obviously you're correct in that the behavior generally is talked about like an underreaction, right? Now, as far as risk, right, like why would momentum securities be riskier? Well, I mean, let's remember actually what the academic momentum finding is, right? The academic finding is that high momentum firms minus low momentum firms have a statistically significant like alpha, right, if you don't control for that factor, right? And so when you add that in, you basically better explain the cross-section of stock terms. And also, which is found similar to that research piece you pointed out today, is that the short book for momentum tends to actually generate probably a bigger portion of the risk. The long, short portfolio returns. So in theory, if you're saying that, you know, momentum is a long, short portfolio and the short book, which are the extreme losers, are generating a lot of the excess returns to that long, short portfolio, it's probably the case that companies that are down a high percentage, let's just say your average loser portfolio is down 70%. I'm just making that up, right? But let's say that's the case. They're probably riskier. I would agree with that. So trying to short them, basically there is risk embedded in that long, short anomaly.\n",

      " Hello and welcome everyone. I'm Corey Hofstein and this is Flirting with Models, the podcast that pulls back the curtain to discover the human factor behind the quantitative strategy. Corey Hofstein is the co-founder and chief investment officer of Newfound Research. Due to industry regulations, he will not discuss any of Newfound Research's funds on this podcast.

This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a basis for investment decisions. Clients of Newfound Research may maintain positions and securities discussed in this podcast. For more information, visit thinknewfound.com. In this episode, I am joined by J.D. Gardner, founder and managing member at Aptis Capital. In his time in the industry, J.D. has served in the role of associate financial advisor, analyst at a deep value equity fund, and analyst at a deep value equity fund. A short-term, systematic managed futures fund. These varying experiences have mixed to culminate into J.D.'s ultimate philosophy. It's all about the investor's return, not the investment return. I like to say no pain, no premium, as a pithy shorthand for the notion that long-term outperformance requires short-term pain along the way. For J.D. and the team at Aptis, their funds are first and foremost, governed by the question of achievability. For them, the contest is not in the theoretical purity of your factor exposure, but rather whether the investor can stick around long enough to actually harvest it. A theoretically sub-optimal solution can be best if it helps the investor bridge the behavior gap. In light of this philosophy, the team at Aptis has launched two strategies. We discussed their fortified value index, one of the more unique spins on value investing that I've come across. Not only does the strategy aim to employ a measure of value that leads to greater investor returns, but it also rolls out-of-the-money put options in effort to protect the portfolio against sudden short-term declines in value that may otherwise invite client misbehavior. Classic Graham and Dodd value investing, this is not. But for some, J.D. argues, a much more achievable alternative. J.D., thank you for joining me today.\n",

I'll be able to make some money playing basketball at some point and I really won't have to worry about all the other stuff. So I just went to school, focused on business and was lucky enough to get in front of a few professors that really kind of changed the course of how things would play out.

And started down that path, and I was able to do, like, started my MBA, finished my MBA while I was on scholarship there, which is, I would not have done that if it hadn't been for the professor, and was actually able to knock out the first couple components of the CFA while I was still young and had no clue what I was doing.\n",

The whole idea is no matter how sound the process is, if you don't have an end user that can sit through the process, that's an issue. That's a behavior gap in itself.

And those simple truths are, if you just own the market in general, I would argue you're going to create wealth. If you just go by the SPY, you're going to create wealth. Well, if you look at the SPY going back to its launch date or whatever, like, well, what has generated those gains? Well, those gains have come from a very small number of stocks that have moved the needle in a big way. You've had a lot of companies go out of business. You had a lot of companies lose market cap. You had a lot of companies do all things that were not positive to the outcome. But the needle still moves because you're going to have a few names that win so much bigger than all the other. So everything that we do, whether it's tilting to different factors or anything, the system is built upon, can we win bigger than we lose and still deliver the factor exposure that we're trying to deliver? And some of the background that ties into that is when you're building short-term systematic strategies, like nothing else matters other than the size of your wins to the size of your losses. If you're going to be 40 to 60 percent right, well, if you do the math, if your ratio is one for one, I'm going to win one, I'm going to lose one in terms of size of P&L, you're really not moving the needle at all.

Not like six months, seven months, eight months, but like five years. Look at value here since 2009. That makes it really your process and the evidence and everything could be spot on.

We look at three metrics to build what's called our value composite. We're looking at a flavor of return on invested capital. So we're trying to basically say what assets are on the books that are used to generate cash flows. How efficient are they with those assets? Let's compare that to the rest of the universe. One of the other components that we look at is cash flow to enterprise value. We think that brings kind of a tilt towards value, along with the initial screen value and quality that makes a lot of sense. And then the third thing that we look at that is really, we hadn't seen anything else like it, and it makes us kind of tilt not necessarily towards true, true value, but we look at PE ratios relative to itself. So how to explain that is like, take a stock, take Apple. I'm making these numbers up. I don't have anything in front of me. Say Apple's trading at a PE ratio of 20 right now. Well, we're going to take a snapshot over the last five years and say, show me where the lowest PE Apple has traded at over the last five year period. And if the closer the current number is to the lowest of the last five years, the higher it's going to be ranked. So what that does, if you think about it, it doesn't get us out of the running. So we look at that every quarter and we rebalance based on those metrics, but also on what have you done for us. And that's a big difference there too, that I know we've touched on.\n",

First is that one of my very early career explorations was in the space of utilizing fundamental metrics to develop a value and quality screen. And that was actually one of the avenues I explored metrics versus their mid to long term historical averages and found it to have a surprising amount of explanatory power. Now, that was analysis I performed over 10 years ago, so I'd have to go back and really look. But it was one of the surprising metrics that I found an incredible amount of consistency with. But it strikes me as a metric that can potentially tilt. You fairly far away from this traditional deep value notion that you could end up owning securities that are trading at maybe a discount to their own historical average, but at a premium much above the market. Do you have any concern that that approach can ultimately dilute the amount of the value premium that you can capture? Sure.\n",

I don't think anybody can look at definitely Amazon. You can't put a price on Amazon. There's no idea what Amazon's worth. Because they're doing things that have really never been seen. So, I'd ask you, what's the greater risk? Own an Amazon at a high PE? Or a stock like Amazon because of high PE? Or not own an Amazon over the next 20 years? Those are the types of companies that, for whatever reason, if they deliver on the first two and they back off on PE for whatever reason, there's value there. It might not be the textbook value definition. So, that's a big rabbit. I just went down.

We're trying to move the needle in the right direction. What we really do that I think is different is take a true momentum fund that rebalances quarterly or take a true value fund. Let's say value, a true value fund that rebalances quarterly. Well, every single quarter, what typically happens is, hey, they're delivering value because the evidence to show that it tends to outperform over whatever time period because of all that stuff. OK, every single quarter when you go to rebalance, what's focused on is just the value exposure. So value should be lower turnover and all of those different things. But what we do. That's a little bit different before we focus on the value exposure. We focus on P&L of our holdings. And how can we still deliver the value exposure we're trying to deliver without shooting ourselves in the foot in terms of our winners versus our losers? We're going to give our winners enough room to run. So if we're going to buy you at 25 and you go to 50. Again, I'm a momentum guy. I would argue that there's a good chance that that 50 is going to turn into 50. And if you're going to buy you at 25 and you go to 50, you're going to have to run from 25 to 75. There's a reason you went from 25 to 50. And let's don't get in the way of that. Let's don't chalk up our wins and say, good job. We doubled. Let's roll. Now, obviously, if the other metrics that we look at does not support that type of growth, you're probably going to get cut. But we just don't want to run a quarterly rebalance where we're just cutting all of our winners and holding all of our losers. We want to be sure that our system is taken into account.

But there's also a few names that are like, well, that's not, I wouldn't consider that a true value play. Why is that in there? So it is a good, again, it goes back to, there's behavioral benefits in that, I mean, you could rattle off multiple value managers that saw huge outflows when value was way out of favor and huge inflows when value was big in favor. And the argument to that, or not the argument, but just the point to make and what we harp on all the time is. A strategy's return is much less important than an investor's return while exposed to the strategy. And despite as much education, as much communication as possible, if you go through a three, four, five year period of looking bad, there's not a lot of investors that we're going to deal with that are going to say, hey, Corey, you've compounded at seven when the market's compounded at 15. I'm sticking with you, man. I think you're really smart. And now what they typically do is they. Pull the plug. And then all of a sudden you compound at 12 when the market compounds at two.

      " So the idea is not only a complimentary basket, but also risk management. So that's where the tail hedging came into play. And so what we do is exactly what you said. We buy puts on the market that from the high level view, people probably think we're just taking 50 bips and throwing it out the window. But in that premium, the price you pay for those puts, there's five ingredients. Obviously, one of the big ones is volatility. And so the level of volatility is going to impact the premium. When the level of volatility is low, your potential protection is going to be much greater than what it would be if volatility was high because you're picking up more. You're getting more bang for your buck. So the very simplified way of thinking about a true tail hedge is you buy something for really cheap that looks like it will never do anything positive for you. And as soon as volatility wakes up, the premium. And that could explode. That's what a true tail hedge is.\n",
      "风险管理是指对冲的价格,所以波动率是波动率的低点,所以波动率的保护率会大于波动率的低点,因为波动率是低的,所以你的潜在的保护率会大于波动率是高的,因为你正在提高.所以,简单的思考方法是买一个尾<unk>,因为你永远不会买任何看起来像它的东西.\n",

      " Yes, exactly. So when you buy, all options have a time to expiration. So if you buy an option, I'm making these numbers up, that the premium's a dollar and it expires next year, 12 months from now. Well, if nothing happens to the underlying security that the option is on and you move out in time three months, absolutely nothing has happened. Well, the premium, you're still going to lose money in that premium because there's going to be some time decay because there's less time. So the option is less valuable. So when you're looking at puts that we're looking at far out of the money, the market knows if you look at, this is another interesting topic, but if you look at the distribution of returns in the market, there's a big fat left tail. So everybody's probably remember stats 101, the normal bell curve. Well, the market's returns are not normally distributed. There's a huge left tail, meaning the market is aware that a left tail event, a big negative event, is going to be a big fat left tail. So if you look at the distribution of returns in the market, you're going to see that the left tail event is more likely than a right tail event. So for that reason, where we're buying in the time to expiration and out of the money, you get a little bit of, I guess, relief from that time decay because you're going to get a, the volatility is going to naturally creep up as you get closer and closer to expiration. And that helps us with, hey, if the market just rips straight up, we want to be sure that we're not forfeiting a lot of the upside. And really what we want the tail hedge to do is to be a significant part of the market. So if we're going to get a little bit of relief from that time decay, we want to get a significant offset to a significant drop in price. So if the market were to drop 20% over the next 30 to 60 days, we want our tail hedge to maybe not offset a star for dollar, but really kick in to minimize drawdown. And what happened in early February, the day the market dropped 4.2%, we had a complete reset of volatility across the board. And so we anticipate a certain level of volatility conservatively in our models that if you're at a time of recession, you're going to drop 20% over the next 30 to 50, 60 days. Where would we expect volatility to be and how much offset would our hedge give us? Well, in a matter of like two hours in early February, volatility went from where it was to where we expected it to be over a 30 plus day window. And so our fortified strategy went absolutely bonkers. You saw this little 50 bips of the account wake up to be not 50 bips anymore. And so we're going to have to wait and see what happens. And so we're going to have to wait and see what happens. And so we're going to have to wait and see what happens. And so we're going to have to wait and see what happens. And so we actually profited significantly on that day.\n",

The second asterisk to that is if you look at how we're rolling, the potential drag is going to be much less than what could be anticipated. The second argument is, well, keep in mind, too, that we have a value-dependent tail hedge. So in the levels of valuation in the overall market as a whole, we are much more prone to a significant drop in market prices than we would be if valuation was 20% lower. So at 20% lower, everything is about probabilities. What's the probability of a 20% drawdown? Well, probabilities of a 20% drawdown. are significantly higher than they would be if we were at a different valuation that was much lower. So if we were much lower, would we have the tail hedge on?

Higher valuations lead to lower returns moving forward and potential for higher risk in terms of drawdown. So that's a bad combination. There's Goldman's got a good paper on that. So if probabilities for greater drawdowns and lower returns moving forward, we probably want to have a tail hedge in place.

The way I view tail hedging, yes, there's going to be some risk management benefits in a sharp drawdown. But also, what's going to happen is you're going to create cash at more opportune times to deploy capital into equities. So, if the markets reset over the next 30 days down 20 and say we generated half of that, 10% in cash, the puts went from 50 basis points to 10% of the strategy. Well, we're now getting to deploy 10% of the strategy back into stocks that are relatively low PECs.

      " In 2008, we started with support vector machines as the model we used for investing as those were state-of-the-art at the time. And then in 2014-15, we migrated our technology to ensemble models for some of the reasons I described earlier. But besides just their accuracy, there's another aspect of ensemble learning that makes it compelling for an investment advisor. And that's that ensembles tend to be built up out of decision trees as their base model. And this is appealing because decision trees are more transparent than, say, a support vector machine or a deep neural network in the sense that you can follow the logic down the decision tree of how it's deciding why a company, for example, is going to outperform the market over the subsequent year or not. And you can do this at quite a granular level. Now, more recently, deep neural networks and deep learning have gotten a lot of attention because of the spectacular successes in areas such as language. There's translation, computer vision, and beating the world champion at the game of Go. And so we, of course, became interested in the idea of seeing how deep learning might benefit our processes. And there are really three reasons why deep learning interests us. First, deep learning has created the opportunity to do less factor engineering work that is so involved in typical quantitative investing and instead rely on raw financial data to tell the story of a story. Second, deep learning has created the opportunity to do less factor engineering work that is so involved in typical quantitative investing and instead rely on raw financial data to tell the story of a story. And as we discussed, the deepness in deep learning means that successive layers of a model are able to untangle important relationships in a hierarchical way from the data as it is found in the wild, like what's in a balance sheet or an income statement. And therefore, there's much less preprocessing than we've had to do in the past, potentially. So, you know, really the way to think about it is there is potential. To find measures or factors that are more meaningful than what we rely on today. And the process of finding them is less biased than it is if you construct them on your own. Second, you know, with respect to deep learning, recurrent neural networks, which is a form of deep learning, have an inherent time dimensionality to them. And with respect to stocks, the future value of a company depends on the evolving state of a company's cash flows as they return. And so, you know, we're going to have to report them from quarter to quarter. It is in this sort of area of modeling sequences of data through time that deep learning is of interest to us. And last is that some of the greatest progress in machine learning has been in this area, or of deep learning, really, has been in this area of text processing. Whether it be language translation or sentence completion or voice recognition or voice synthesis. Clearly, there's a lot of textual data out there on stocks. That is not reflected in income statements or balance sheets. And it would be great to be able to use that information in the decision-making process insofar as it's of value. As a cautionary note, however, there are some less appealing aspects of moving to deep learning. First and foremost is the issue of transparency. As I described before, an ensemble of decision trees is much more transparent than a deep neural network. Because the logic of what it is. What it does is embedded, of a deep neural network, is embedded into all the connections that it's made up of. And second, from a more practical perspective, is that training deep neural networks takes a very long time. And therefore, it's hard to quickly iterate through a lot of ideas as it is with support vector machines or ensembles of decision trees. But also in the context of deep neural networks, there is still this important issue of how you frame the question. Whether you're using support vector machines. Ensembles of decision trees or deep neural networks. You still need to decide whether you're going to frame the question as a classification problem or as a regression problem. As I mentioned earlier, most of our success has been in framing it as classification problem because, well, it turns out that that is an easier problem to solve. But maybe deep neural networks provide an opportunity to succeed at something harder.\n",

I think stock A is going to outperform stock B is orders of magnitude less complex than I think stock A is going to outperform stock B by 5%, which is orders of magnitude less complex than I think stock A is going to return 22% and stock B is going to return 17%. And your confidence in the former can be incredibly high. And while they all might technically say the same thing, they all agree, you know, they'll all be true at the same time.

      " So as I mentioned, we formulated the challenge of applying machine learning to long-term investing as a classification problem as opposed to a regression problem, meaning that we said we want the model to tell us, hey, this looks like a good long-term investment instead of the model saying, you know, this stock will return 20% above the market over the next year. And the reason we took this approach is for the same reasons that you're mentioning, that it just seems like a more tractable problem. And as it turns out, empirically, this is the case. You can do quite well if you pose problem of long-term investing in this way. Now, that being said, with the advent of deep learning and observing that it has been successful on some very challenging problems where there's lots of noise and the signal needs to be kind of teased out of it, we started to reinvestigate whether deep learning could be successfully used to forecast excess returns. And what we found was that deep neural networks were essentially no better than linear regression at this problem. Now, that doesn't mean that they can't forecast excess returns as linear regression actually does have some predictive power in forecasting. That is essentially why something like the value effect or the momentum effect exists. There is a relationship between those factors and the excess return of a stock. It's just that relationship is best modeled with a linear model. There's Occam's razor. Don't use a model that's any more complex than it needs to be. But in this process, we also started to ask the question, well, if we can't forecast prices with a deep neural network, maybe we can forecast something else. And borrowing on the idea of sequence learning and language translation and other uses of recurrent neural networks, we explored whether you could use a sequence learning model to predict the rate of return of a stock. And that's a very important thing. So, we found that it's really important to have a sequence of historical financial statements to forecast future financials or future fundamentals. And it is in this area that we've had a good degree of success with deep neural networks.\n",

      " So I read a paper this morning, and I'm forgetting the exact title, but it was something to the effect of deep alpha. And it was this idea of using a deep neural network for the very reasons you mentioned, which is there doesn't need to be any preemptive feature engineering. You can feed it this raw data. And one of the added benefits of using this deep neural network is the opportunity to identify nonlinear features that very often a lot of the features we pre-engineer are very linear in nature. Identifying nonlinear relationships in the data and allowing that to flow through the deep neural network in the classification problem was their way of trying to identify unique sources of alpha. But to a layperson like me. Who is not incredibly sophisticated in the realm of machine learning. This sounds a whole lot like it's just overfitting the data. That there is a massive risk of just passing all of this information in and letting the model identify that information, which was most predictive in the past. But perhaps it is just identifying nothingness and noise. That there's a lot of spurious relationships. That it's uncovering. Talk me through, particularly with something like a deep neural network where they are entirely opaque. And a lot of the reason within the model is hidden deep in the layers. How do you gain confidence that you're not overfitting? And I want to say I almost find it ironic because you didn't start using deep neural networks until the last couple of years. But you actually wrote a piece very early on at Euclidean about how you gain confidence. In a machine learning approach. And so maybe that you can tie that in sort of the criteria you outlined. But how do you think about gaining confidence in an approach in which by definition there's an extreme lack of transparency?\n",

      " It may sound like overfitting, but in this case, it's not. I think it's worthwhile to clarify the relationship between machine learning and overfitting. The fitting of data is, in fact, a spectrum going from underfit to overfit. And somewhere in the middle there is a point that is like this Goldilocks point where you're not too underfit and you're not too overfit. This is the point where a model is said to optimally generalize the relationship in the training data to the out-of-sample data. The tools of machine learning like regularization, cross-validation, and holdout testing are designed to allow you to navigate the spectrum so that you can find this Goldilocks point of generalization. So take computer vision as an example where there's been a lot of success with deep neural networks. There's a tremendous amount of noise in images. We don't notice how extreme it is because our brains are so good at converting a field of pixels into recognizable objects. But just imagine the diversity of pixels. And pixel combinations that exist in a photo of something like an Arabian bazaar. Then imagine how those combinations multiplies lighting changes throughout the day. So how is it possible that we are able to build perceptual systems that are able to visually navigate a self-driving car? Wouldn't those perceptual systems just overfit the noise in all that video? The answer is regularization. Without it, we would have none of the successes we see. It's not about being able to do that. we're not going to be able to do that without the complexity that we see with neural networks today. Now there is this relationship between the complexity of a model, and again deep neural networks are very complex, and how much data we have for a given problem. The more complex the model, the more data you need. And I've heard this argument that in finance there just isn't enough data to support the complexity of a deep neural network as there is with computer vision. But in this particular problem, forecasting future fundamentals from, you know, historic fundamentals, there's actually plenty of data. So we can do the math. If we're interested in five-year time series, then that's a data point, then how many five-year time series on company fundamentals are there? If we use a sample historic period to learn from of 35 years, and assume we have approximately 2,500 companies at each given time, and that we were looking at monthly data, if you multiply those three numbers together, we have close to a million unique time series to learn from, which is plenty for the purpose of deep learning. Now, there are aspects of financial data that can make learning, in any kind of inference for that matter, challenging. So like any problem, we have this issue when learning of trying to infer a distribution from only a sample of data. And we're successful if we're able to infer that really well. relationship from the data on out-of-sample data. But because the time dimensionality of financial data, the underlying true distribution that we're trying to learn can change. That is, this distribution can be what's called non-stationary, so that whatever you learn in one time period may not be true in the next time period.\n",

      " You absolutely read my mind because this is exactly where I wanted to go next. This discussion of machine learning seems incredibly well suited for data sets that are implicitly stationary, as you mentioned. And it seems to have made huge advancements in areas where there are well-defined rules or games where there's ultimately defined boundaries. So Go is an incredibly complex game, but there are ultimately governing rules. If you ascribe to someone like Andrew Lowe's adaptive market hypothesis, the degree of competition within the market is ultimately in some way changing the rules. And in many ways, the rules have changed over time. The way, for example, that CFOs may report financials has changed over time. How do you tackle this issue of non-stationarity in the data? And maybe just more generally. Is machine learning applicable in finance at all?\n",

      " Sure, but this is not so much an issue with machine learning, but rather a question of when and where inference can be done at all. If you have extremely non-stationary data where the distribution is constantly changing from one period to the next, then any statistical description of the data in prior time periods is of no real value in the next. Now, there are tools that can be employed if you have non-stationary data that is slowly changing through time. And that is to iteratively build models, be it a linear regression or a neural network, that use data from a fixed trailing window of time to forecast into the current or next time period. So let's say you believe that your distribution is relatively stable over a four month period. Then if you want to make forecasts for April, you build a model on data from January through March and use that model to make your April forecasts. And then you repeat this process for forecasts in May by building a model. And then you build a model on data from the period February through April. And you can see how you can just iterate this approach out on forever. We do a form of this at Euclidean when we're forecasting fundamentals, but our time window is closer to 20 years than four months. And this gets to the point of why at Euclidean we focus on long-term value investing or fundamental investing. Because it's a more stationary problem than other types of investing. I mean, it's pretty well understood that the value of an asset is its future cash flows discounted to present value. And that's true, was true in 1925, it was also true in 2007, it's true in 2018, and it will be true in 2050. Therefore, if we can forecast cash flows in the future with any degree of accuracy, you should have an investment approach that would work well over the long run. Whatever forecasting model that is, it should be valuable regardless of what decade it's being used in.\n",

      " So one of the things we've touched upon here, one of the benefits potentially of a deep neural network is that you don't have to pre-engineer your factors. But in many ways, it strikes me that what makes someone a quant value investor is that pre-engineering in a certain way, that the factors that they are by definition looking at have to do with valuation. So they might be looking at price to book. They might be looking at enterprise value to EBITDA. It strikes me that when you just provide all the raw input to the deep neural network, maybe it's how you ask the question of the deep neural network that ultimately makes you a value investor. So I guess the question I would pose to you is if you're passing in all this raw data, what is it necessarily that connects you to the history of value investing that would make you say that you're applying machine learning to value investing?

And all I want to assess is whether this company is going to be a good long-term investment or not. Now, the reality is that when you train any kind of model with that setup, it'll inevitably come up with a model that is characteristically value in nature. And that is just because of the strength of the value effect in the data. It's embedded in the combination of base economic principles of mean reversion and human behavioral biases, which create the effect. And therefore, it's existed for a very, very long time and will continue to exist. Now, with a value model, there is, of course, value investments, good value investments, and there are also value traps.

But we could forecast future fundamentals from historical fundamentals much better than we could with a linear model or with a random walk. Now, you need to ask, is there any value to forecasting future fundamentals? Don't we really want to know how an investment's going to do, not how the fundamentals are going to unfold? So to empirically answer this question, what we did was imagine that at each point in time we had clairvoyant access to future fundamentals, i.e. we could see the future. So say it's December 1983, and we give our hypothetical selves access to 1984 year-end earnings for all companies. And then we take these future earnings and construct a factor by dividing the earnings, the future earnings by the current December 1983 enterprise value, and construct portfolios of stocks by this factor. And so through simulation, we show that using this hypothetical clairvoyant factor, you would have generated just fantastic returns in excess of 40%. And so in our minds, this result motivates a desire to forecast fundamentals in as accurate a way as possible. And I think that this is just a very important factor. And I think that this is just a very important factor. And I think that this is just a very important factor. And I think that this is just a very important factor. So I think that's the tip of the iceberg on this idea of forecasting fundamentals. There are a lot of interesting directions we can take this research, and that includes using unstructured data, since we're using deep neural networks to help improve the forecast. And then there's this idea of forecasting under uncertainty. For example, in the real world, two investments that look extremely similar can have different outcomes, both in price, but also in how they're fundamentals evolve. And this is just a product of the natural uncertainty involved in companies and investing. Earlier, I mentioned these guys at Amazon that have been doing a lot of work on this problem of forecasting not just a value in the future, but forecasting not the expected value of something in the future, but in forecasting the entire distribution of outcomes. And if you knew what the distribution of outcomes and not just what the expected value was, you could construct portfolios in a much more rigorous and interesting way. And so I think using techniques like deep autoregressive recurrent neural networks, I think it's a very interesting and promising area.\n",

      " this ties into a topic I want to get into a little bit, which is that today, most researchers and practitioners would agree that we probably have a P hacking problem in the industry and a lot of other industries as well, where just when you have so many people evaluating the same data, you're bound to end up with a lot of false positives. So we've discussed this fact that deep neural networks, by definition, we don't have to pre-engineer the factors, and we can just sort of allow the machine to programmatically search for methods of selection, weight the importance, transform the data, which to a very naive ear, mine included, sounds a lot like data mining. But you have made the argument in the past that, and I've read a lot of the papers, I've read this on your blog, that machine learning can actually be, when done correctly, many of the techniques of machine learning can be more robust to the problems found in traditional factor research. And I was hoping you could expand on that for me a little bit, and maybe some of the lessons that machine learning can offer to traditional factor research.\n",
      "P-hacking是指在某些行业中,P-hacking是指对数据进行分析,包括我所做的研究我读过很多论文,我读过这个博客,我发现机器学习技术可以扩展到很多传统的问题,但当它被正确地使用时,它可以扩展到其他问题\n",
      "******\n",
      "******\n",
      " So I think it's worthwhile to explain a little bit what p-hacking is. In the social sciences and natural sciences, the way that you show statistical significance for a number, let's say the alpha in a back test, is you construct a 99 or 95 percent confidence interval around that number. And the way that you interpret that interval is that if you were to run the experiment a hundred times, constructing a hundred confidence intervals on each try, you should expect the true value, that is the true alpha in the back test example, to be in 95 percent of those confidence intervals. And in five of those experiments, the true value will not be in the interval you construct. Now notice the nature of this. The more times you repeat the experiment, the more likely the chances are that the true value, the true alpha, is not in the constructed interval. And so if you think about this in the context of repeatedly testing for new factors, the more times you attempt to make the higher confidence interval, the more likely the chances are that the true value is not in the example. So you can't predict the likelihood that you will get a spurious result. Now in machine learning, there's a long history of using techniques like out-of-sample testing and cross-validation to help avoid being misled in this way by the data. And instead, when you build a model, you don't validate whether you're confident in the model on the same data that you built it on. You validate its success on out-of-sample data. So to be fair, I think there's been, you know, some complaints from the finance community about the fact that the true value is not in the community that out-of-sample testing and cross-validation are not well suited for time series data. But that has really changed a lot in the last several years. And there are now fairly powerful techniques that have been adapted to time series and finance in general. In particular, there's a paper called The Probability of Backtest Overfit, which introduces this tool that you can download freely to run your backtest through. And this algorithm, The Probability of Backtest Overfit, which was inspired by the machine learning technique called cross-validation, allows you to validate whether your series of backtests is likely to be overfit or not. My point is, is there is a wealth of research in the machine learning community on how to prevent getting fooled by your data and analysis. And I think the finance community could benefit from better understanding this work.\n",

      " One of the interesting rabbit holes I went down in preparation for talking with you today was this idea of adversarial examples. And it seems to come up a lot in image classification where a neural network is trained to classify an image as an object. And by changing one little tiny detail about the image, often imperceptible to the human eye, the neural network is completely confident. It is not what the image is or the opposite direction. An image that to the human eye looks like complete noise is classified with 100% confidence as being the image. And this idea that by exploiting, I guess they're called almost activation pathways of these neural networks, these heavily used activation pathways, by exploiting the structure after the neural network has been put in place, you can come up with these examples. That show really how fragile the neural network may be. And obviously maybe there isn't a direct correlation to investing necessarily. But it strikes me again that this balance of the threat of opaqueness and fragility of a neural network would almost require a higher degree of confidence to use it. That for me, something like a price to book, price to earnings is a very transitive. And I think that's something that we should be looking at. And I think that's something that I think is a very important piece of the approach that we're looking at. I want to go back to this idea of developing confidence in this thought of in applying a very, very new concept, something that's really only gotten very popular in the last couple of years and maybe isn't incredibly well understood yet. Talk to me again about how you go about developing your confidence in applying that approach.\n",

      " Yeah. So the adversarial example is really a kind of creepy thing. And it's related to this whole issue of transparency and model explainability. As I said before, it's very comforting to use an ensemble of decision trees because you can follow the logic of how a model is making a decision about a particular investment. Whereas with a deep neural network, it's not so straightforward. But I would caution here that these issues, adversarial examples and model explainability are insurmountable problems. I mean, going back again to self-driving cars, we're not going to accept a car that crashes more just because we can explain why it made the decision it made. We're going to use the best models there are. And these models are going to be held to a higher standard than even a human in terms of explainability. And that's because it's just not acceptable for a car also to kill someone and not be able to explain why. And so essentially, the incentives are so big and the people who are working, super smart. So this is going to get figured out. And not surprisingly, there's a lot of great research going on in this area, basically, in how to take actions of deep neural networks and convert any specific action into an explanation.

And then the final one that I would argue is an emotional edge, that everyone's got the same information. They can all interpret it with the same accuracy, but you've got better fortitude to hold through pain when other investors fold and pass you the alpha. Machine learning has been this really interesting space that's really been driven by an open source endeavor, that a lot of companies like Facebook and Google are publishing all of these tools that lower the barrier to entry for people who want to start exploring data sets with machine learning. And it strikes me that if machine learning is really an analytical edge, in that second category, that there's going to be to a large degree, an arms race that leads to diminishing returns in the applicability of machine learning as an investment edge.

If it's known, it's going to be susceptible to being arbitraged away. This is obviously maybe more true with higher frequency trading. But even in factor models, you're starting to see people wondering, wow, does book-to-market really work anymore? And some argue that it doesn't work because maybe the balance sheet doesn't reflect true value of assets anymore, especially intangibles. But others make the argument that it's just an overcrowded factor. I think the verdict is still out on that. It is interesting that with machine learning, there is a sort of flip side of the lack of transparency when we don't engage in factor engineering and instead use raw financial information as input to, say, a deep neural network. I mean, that is the model remains a sort of secret sauce embedded within this deep neural network.

      " Yeah. So in 2008, Michael Seckler, my longtime business partner, and I founded Euclidean specifically on this idea of applying machine learning to long-term equity investing. Mike and I had built a software as a service business over the prior decade that we sold to ADP, Automatic Data Processing, in 2006. And we had made a little money off that sale and so started to think about how to grow that wealth over the remainder of our lives. And I sought out wisdom on this subject in the writings of people who had been great long-term investors, people that achieved high returns over very, very long periods of time, not folks that achieved a great result from a couple of trades. And if you ask this question, you inevitably end up learning a lot about Ben Graham, Walter Schloss, John Templeton, and of course, Buffett. And the thing that I observed is that most of the time, I've been doing a lot of research on the market. And I've been most of these folks are very open about how they invest and essentially describe it in this way, that they look at the historical financials, the publicly available information on companies, perhaps going back decades, and try to get a sense of what the economic character or intrinsic value of the business is. And if that value is attractive relative to what you might be able to buy the company for, then it's considered a good investment. And in thinking through this, again, that there are a lot of people who are very open about the historical financials, but they're not very open publicly available information and price and that I had a deep background in machine learning going back to the early 90s, that I might be able to imitate this success using machine learning. Note that I'm not saying that our goal was to directly imitate what specific long-term fundamental investors do. I wasn't, for example, trying to make a Graham model, so to speak. Rather, if you give a machine learning algorithm all his money, you're going to get a lot of money. If you ask it to distinguish between historical fundamentals and price, and ask it to distinguish between winners and losers in that data, then it will be successful if it is possible to succeed on that data alone. The machine learning algorithm should be able to find in the data this relationship between long-term fundamentals of companies, their prices, and success as future success as an investment, so long as that relationship actually does exist. So this is what we said about to do. Now, this may seem unusual, applying machine learning to long-term investing. It seems like most people apply it to short-term investing. I'd like to point out that if you look around at other fields where machine learning has had a lot of success in achieving good results, it's in areas where we're trying to improve upon human decision-making. So take, for example, self-driving cars. In that case, you may build a perceptual system, a neural network, that is trained to do a better job at perceiving the environment that a human would, in a car. In medicine, what they're doing is they're taking medical images and attempting to identify whether there's a malignant tumor in it, trying to improve upon the radiologist's ability to identify whether there's a malignancy or not. And in the stunning example, of course, it's a game, but in the stunning example of AlphaGo, where neural networks were trained to beat the world masters at the game of Go, obviously what they're doing there is they're building a machine, an algorithm, that's going to be able to do that. And so, you know, it's a machine-based algorithm that does a better job than a human at that task. Well, in the world of capital markets, we have all these people who go around and evaluate companies based on their fundamentals and try to understand if they're going to be a good long-term investor. Essentially, what Euclidean set out to do is improve upon that process with machine learning. So I think it's important to point out also that most big machine learning successes are in the form of what's called a classification problem and not a regression problem. Regression is where you build a model to predict numeric values, like predicting the percent return of a stock. Classification is where you predict categorical values. So if listeners remember the Silicon Valley episode where Jin Yang built the hot dog, not hot dog image classification app to, I think, get him out of indentured servitude, that's a good example of a classification app. You know, even language translation is a form of classification where you are predicting one of a number of numbers. And so, you know, if you're going to build a model to predict numbers, you're going to have to have a lot of words in a language that should be translated to. Typically, when people look at equity forecasting, they are doing regression. So instead, we structured the problem as a classification problem. You know, that is, we're predicting whether something is going to be a good investment or a bad investment. We did this because, you know, it's our view that this is an easier, less noisy problem than trying to forecast, say, excess return.\n",

      " Maybe before we dive deep down the rabbit hole, which I think we're going to get to very quickly, maybe we can start with the way you see the landscape of machine learning. Because there's a number not only of techniques, which I know we're going to talk about, but the purpose of those techniques. So you've already, for example, mentioned regression versus classification. But we know that there's been an evolution from things like support vector machines to deep neural networks over the last decade. Maybe we can start with discussing that landscape a little and where you draw the line between machine learning and more advanced statistical techniques.\n",

      "******\n",
      "******\n",
      " So the question on the relationship between machine learning and statistics is an interesting one, and I think the answer is somewhat nuanced. For some forms of machine learning, it's clearly a subset of statistics, or at least intimately related to statistics, whereas other forms of machine learning take on a very different character. For example, in supervised learning, which is the most popular and successful form, you're trying to map a set of inputs to a set of outputs through a model. And this process is very similar to what you're doing in statistical linear regression, where you have, if you remember, an independent variable x and a dependent variable y, and you're trying to relate them through a linear model. The difference being that in supervised learning, it tends to be a more complicated model with many more parameters, and you're employing techniques to prevent overfitting. But because both linear regression and supervised learning are essentially attempting to do the same thing, I think it would be hard to argue that supervised machine learning is not a form or extension of statistics. On the other hand, if you look at something like reinforcement learning, where the model is an agent in an environment, and the model can take actions, and those actions have outcomes that are then fed back to the model and used to reinforce its behavior, I think in that case, it's taking on a very different character than traditional statistics, and therefore is different. With respect to the landscape of machine learning, ensemble learning techniques have had a lot of success. There's this result that shows that the average decision made by a group of models that have been trained to make uncorrelated decisions has a better chance of success than the best individual model within the group. So it's sort of like saying that some of the parts is greater than the whole, or that there's this wisdom. So it's sort of like saying that some of the parts is greater than the whole, or that there's this wisdom. At any rate, this result led to a vigorous effort to develop algorithms that train many models to make uncorrelated decisions. And it has been shown that these ensembles perform very well. If you look at the CAGLE competition, which is a worldwide competition where data sets are put out there and researchers can submit their best models, and they're ranked according to their accuracy on out-of-sample data, if you look at the top-down data, you can see that the data sets are ranked according to their accuracy on out-of-sample data. If you look at the top-down data, you can see that the data sets are ranked according to their accuracy on out-of-sample data. They tend to be dominated by these ensemble techniques, and so even though ensembles don't get the headlines, like deep learning, and so even though ensembles don't get the headlines, like deep learning, which I'll talk about here in a second, I would argue that if you have an application where you're interested in employing machine learning, I would argue that if you have an application where you're interested in employing machine learning, So you can find out if you're going to be successful with it pretty quickly. But the other maybe more sexy technique that does get a lot of the headlines is deep learning. So what is deep learning? Deep learning is learning in an artificial neural network where input is transformed to output through many processing units and parameters that are typically organized into these successive layers. Hence the deep, deep in terms of layers in the term deep learning. The transformation of input to output through all these nodes and connections can be very complex. There can be millions of connections slash parameters in these models. And hence deep learning can model these very challenging problems. Most of the problems that it's really good at are things that historically have been very hard to solve with a computer. Or traditional computing techniques. Things like computer vision, language translation, and voice recognition. Again though I'd say ensemble learning is best for most problems. But deep learning seems to be best at the most challenging. In finance, forecasting is of course of great interest. And it's interesting that a lot of these companies that are investing heavily in machine learning for their products. Such as Google and Facebook and Amazon. Are also very interested in the challenge of forecasting. As I think they believe it's relevant to their business. Like right, Amazon is well served to be able to forecast product to fit man. So it can effectively manage its inventory. And you can see this in academic papers that are coming out. Where these folks have started to leverage their expertise in machine learning into challenging forecasting problems. For example, there's a group again at Amazon. That published a series of paper on using deep learning to improve forecasting under uncertainty. And they showed that it does meaningfully better than traditional forecasting techniques. And what do I mean by uncertainty? Well this again is very related to finance. Where it's very hard to forecast an exact number in the future. You know that a stock is going to go up 10%. Or that we're going to sell 35,000 toothbrushes. Next month. But maybe you can get a sense of what the distribution of outcomes are going to be. And so Amazon built this tool. Which is now available in the Amazon cloud. I think it's called DeepAR. For deep auto regressive neural network. Where they have this recurrent neural network. That you can use to build these forecasting models. Where you're not trying to forecast a value. But forecast a distribution of outcomes. And so Amazon has a tool. At any rate it seems like there is a very direct crossover potential. Of this technology to finance applications.\n",

But as we've been sort of talking about, there's been a massive acceleration in the last decade for many of the reasons you discussed, both from the hardware perspective, the use of GPUs, as well as some of the algorithms that have been discovered to solve some of the problems that were facing things like deep neural networks, has allowed for a massive acceleration of the techniques and therefore the application of deep neural networks and the success of deep neural networks in the last decade. From a practitioner standpoint, someone who's using machine learning, who started a decade ago where things like support vector machines, machines were state of the art, and then suddenly it became ensemble methods, and now today it's deep neural networks. How do you think about adapting your process as the field of machine learning is changing so quickly?\n",

They have invested heavily in these areas. And this investment is both in the form of innovations that are published in peer-reviewed journals but also in the form of open-source projects where very complex pieces of software like Google's TensorFlow are written and put out there for anybody to download and use. And since our inception, it has sort of behooved us to take advantage of the fact that we're living in this pretty incredible time.\n",

Short-term trend has been a negative carry strategy for as far as the eye can see. And it looks just like long vol. And then as you move out the trend length into longer-term trend horizons, it becomes much less like a very near-term, very close-to-the-money put option, and much more like a long beta, far-out-of-the-money put option, where you're willing to give up a very substantial amount of early drawdown or acute drawdown in order to preserve a higher long-term premium.

Well, if you equal weight all those different return series, you see about 1.5 independent bets.

And so just going back to Grinnell's fundamental law of active management, then what it says is your expected risk-adjusted performance is a function of skill in the square root of breadth, right? So if you've got a breadth of 2 versus breadth of 1.5, then your sort of force multiplier on expected performance is the square root of 2 over 1.5, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of about 17% excess expected performance just by taking an analytical look.

      " Yeah, we definitely have higher margins. Some of that is just embedded in the higher cost of setup. I mean, we reviewed a little bit of that during the conference. And, I mean, having been registered under Ontario Security Commission and then subsequently becoming registered under the SEC, I mean, you can get registered under the SEC as an RIA. If you can fog a mirror in Canada, you need to have a CFA. You've got to have somebody who's got the directors and officers course, who's got two or three years of compliance training, the principal portfolio manager's got to be a CFA, who's got five years of experience managing a minimum amount of assets, that have $100,000 or so in escrow. So just there's a much higher cost of setup. I suspect part of that's due to the fact that it's such a concentrated financial services structure in Canada and the banks have absolutely no incentive to make it, and it's not easy. So that's different from the SEC, which is obviously funded by the government and is independent of the banks. So it's a different regulatory regime. Makes a pretty big difference. Cool. So with that background... Also, as a point of clarification,\n",

      " I wouldn't say I've got a super deep background. My undergrad was in computer science. I took machine learning courses. I guess for me, I've always just had a preference towards simplicity in the sense of when I think of a machine learning model that might introduce some opacity into my process. I always think there is a associated model risk. And when I think of all the risks associated in investing, model risk is one of those less tangible, harder to quantify type risks, but it's there. And I just haven't really found the need to go down the machine learning rabbit hole. Now, that said, what I think is interesting for me is as machine learning gets more popular, some of the techniques are bubbling out. And a lot of this, my conversation with John was very enlightening on my podcast. Some of those techniques, I think, can lead to better hypothetical simulations, better backtesting, just better research techniques. Yes. But it doesn't mean you're necessarily. You're not putting anything into practice. Your process doesn't have to use machine learning, but you can use machine learning concepts in your research. And I think that's where I've been leaning more lately is different ways of thinking about combining signals, using decision trees, different ways of thinking about constructing portfolios, which I know you have gone down that rabbit hole pretty deep on the machine learning side. But there's some really interesting concepts there of saying, how can I use machine learning not to necessarily give me an edge? In discovering alpha, but to give me an edge in building a more robust process, almost not the alpha side of the coin, but the risk side, if that makes any sense.\n",

      " No, I think it makes sense, but really, I think everybody thinks of machine learning. Many people think of machine learning as this magic wand that you can kind of wave at a data set. And if you do it properly, then these patterns or these signals emerge that are highly reliable or at least easily testable. And that there are well-documented and established rules about how to engineer those signals and how to determine the optimal tradeoff between bias and variance. And the reality is when you dig into that field, you realize that you just introduce a whole other layer of parameters that you can use to fit the problem. Right. So it actually is far easier. To overfit with machine learning processes. But the whole science of machine learning is learning about more robust ways to derive signals that are more likely to be persistent and meaningful out of sample. Right. So it's like any tool set. If you give somebody a tool, if you give a person who doesn't know how to use a chainsaw a chainsaw, then clearly they are a dangerous weapon. But if you give somebody with experience.

      " It's just the concept of ensembles, of boosting and bagging, of resampling. These are technically ideas that are derived from machine learning literature. But once you have moved through the process of strategy design for long enough, they actually become second nature. It's not something that you... you don't sort of go to the machine learning literature and learn that there's a name for it and then you use it. We've been using it for years. And then once you begin to dig into the literature in information science and machine learning, then you discover that there's a name for it and that there are mathematically rigorous ways to apply it and to measure ex ante what the expected benefits should be from these approaches. We've been leaning pretty heavily on this. We've been leaning pretty heavily on concepts like bagging unsupervised learning, where you're creating clusters of similar assets, and then you use those clusters to create a structured resampling process. I mean, the whole idea, we focus a lot on portfolio optimization. And the challenge with portfolio optimization is you've got this covariance matrix that each individual element in it actually... actually... has fairly high reliability. But the matrix itself is sparse. And so there's this idea of shrinkage, where you want to shrink the correlations towards some sort of unbiased estimator or unbiased prior. And then the question is, what sort of shrinkage method? How much do you shrink the estimates? So some of these questions can be answered very intuitively by using things like cross-validation. And it's funny because the idea of shrinkage is linked to resampling, is linked to regularization and an optimization process itself. It's linked to constraints. So the long-only constraint, for example, does a miraculous job of producing much more stable portfolios. So much of the literature on optimization that illustrates challenges with optimization doesn't include these really natural constraints that go a very long way to solving the problem and making it very practical.\n",

You can extract all these nonlinear relationships. I don't want to say you can just throw everything in a blender and get a five star dinner out of it. But it sort of felt like that was the sell on machine learning. And as I dig more into the machine learning space, I guess the way I've been thinking about it is all these estimates we use in portfolio construction, whether it's something to do with an alpha signal or something to do with portfolio construction, they're all misleadingly precise. You look at a covariance matrix and you got decimal precision out to as many infinite as you want it to be. But it doesn't mean it's more accurate. The whole thing is shrouded in a distribution. And when you start putting a portfolio together, that is typically a number of steps that are nonlinear functions of prior step. Yep. That estimation error can dramatically spike.

There's some other interesting things that I can add on that would make this more robust. But I think when you get into this space and you're working on portfolio construction, you tend to start playing with these ideas anyway.

Well, you have a lot of weight on the first few returns that are closest to today's return and very little weight on the returns that are a little further away around like a year from now, right? It turns out that if you reverse engineer it, it's a much closer. To the reverse of that, where the near term returns get very little weight and the further out returns get some positive weight.

      " Hello and welcome everyone. I'm Corey Hofstein and this is Flirting with Models, the podcast that pulls back the curtain to discover the human factor behind the quantitative strategy. Corey Hofstein is the co-founder and chief investment officer of Newfound Research. Due to industry regulations, he will not discuss any of Newfound Research's funds on this podcast. All opinions expressed by podcast participants are solely their own opinion and do not reflect the opinion of Newfound Research. This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a basis for investment decisions. Clients of Newfound Research may maintain positions and securities discussed in this podcast. For more information, visit thinknewfound.com. My guest this episode likely needs a little introduction. His paper, A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation, is the highest ranked paper on SSRN with over 200,000 downloads at the point of recording. But Meb Faber-Hill, who is the co-founder and chief investment officer of Newfound Research, interests go far beyond tactical asset allocation. His work over the last decade plus, from his blog to his podcast to the books he has authored, spans broad topics such as shareholder yield, global value, hard asset alternatives, risk parity, and angel investing, just to name a few. I rarely enter these podcast conversations with a singular objective. Being a prolific writer, however, there is very little that someone cannot find out about, Meb's investment beliefs through a simple Google search. What I was keen to learn in this conversation is what drives those beliefs. Why does Meb keep searching and exploring? Is it simple curiosity, or is there a deeper underlying philosophy that unifies his body of work? As you can likely guess from the title of this podcast, there is indeed a unifying theory, but I'll let Meb explain. Thank you for joining me today. Great to be here in my office. In your office.\n",

      " wrote it? Like most people with their careers, there's a lot of serendipity. And so I was young, 20-something, know nothing, and had just started Cambria. And for many of the designations, you know, CFA has like three levels of terrible tests. There's the kind of technical analysis cousin, redheaded stepchild version of the CFA, which is called the CMT by the MTA organization. And like CFA, it has three levels. And the third level used to be, you could either take the test or write a paper. And the problem with a lot of the CMT world and technical analysis is a lot of it to me is kind of in the same category as mythology. You know, a lot of it is fantastic and a wonderful base for other things. I believe in a lot of things, but then you have all sorts of weird stuff in that world that to me probably doesn't have any sense of the world. And so I have a whole lot of serious sort of base for it. So anyway, they announced that they were going to do away with the third level paper. And I started having panic because the last thing I ever wanted to do, like many people, is take another test, half of which I didn't believe. So memorize it, regurgitate it. So you had to turn in an abstract by the end of the year. So I turned in an abstract, very poorly written, like two sentences on literally like December 30th. And it said something along the lines of, you know, a trend following approach to markets or something. And then I was like, well, crap, now I have to go and write it. And it started, you know, trend following looks over 100 years old. You could even go back probably a couple hundred years as an investment methodology, very similar to value, right? Very, very long time sort of origins. And so what I did was just take a very simple approach to trend following that made it really simple for investment. And I started to look at the market as a whole, and I started to look at the market as a whole, and I started to look at the market as a whole, and I started to look at the market as a whole. But also put in the context of a typical asset allocation portfolio, a lot of trend following would get applied the origins that most are familiar with institutional community is the CTAs, commodity trade advisors of the 70s, you know, the very famous sort of turtles and all that sort of stuff, long, short trades 50 100 markets. So I said, Well, let's, let's take it down to the kind of normal advisor individual level. Let's just show how very basic trend following works on typical asset classes like S&P 500. So did the modeling wrote the paper, original title of the paper was something along the lines of market timing approach to asset allocation, something with the word market timing in the title, and no one would read it. As you know, there's certain phrases that just automatically causes cause people's brains just to just misfire. And market timing may be the queen of them all like that, that is the biggest, probably phrase that causes people to line up on two sides. Anyway, I'm talking politics or religion. So I eventually changed the title to the current title, which is a quantum approach to tactical asset allocation, published it. Again, I had never published, I had never even considered publishing an academic literature. But I said, you know what, this is kind of fun paper may as well I've written it, submitted it to a bunch of friends and a bunch of luminaries that I looked up to three quarters of which either didn't respond to email or told me that I was an idiot and market timing is impossible, including a couple Nobel laureates. And a couple people offered really thoughtful reviews of it. And one in particular said, Meb, look, you know, this is a good idea. It works. The way you've written this is a C paper. And honestly, to get it published in one of the top journals, like you need to write it in the format that these academics write it, and you know, clean it up a lot and work on it and get into that format. And then you probably have a chance. And so I did. And by the way, that was Robert or not, who, you know, is his manages, I think, 200 billion now at this point close to it. But but that also made a huge impression on me for the rest of my career where I said, Man, look, if it made such a huge difference to me that a lot of these people would take the time or not, and some being downright rude and just very dismissive anyway. So I've only published two academic papers. I've written a dozen or so but but after that one experience of publishing academic paper, which there's like a year lead time, it goes through peer review, then it goes back and you get comments and back and after that, I said, Man, I'm just gonna toss this online and let the entire world tear it apart as opposed to two guys, you know, in academia, because you'll get a lot more feedback that way anyway. But I finally published my second one, which was about the first one 10 years later, and as a retrospective, and I was very, I think, honest and humble. And I said, Look, if this paper came out no nine, he would have been like, cool, but no shit Sherlock, you know, it's obviously market timing works. After the fact, so obviously, so much of the paper, popularity was because it came out before the crisis said, this is how trend following model works. And then it worked. But of course, the funny part too, is that trend following in many cases has also struggled since then, and the ensuing period. So you've seen kind of both sides. And I think for like any investment approach, it's so important to be thoughtful and understand both the good and the bad sides.\n",

You look at the backtest performance and they go live and then it's terrible afterwards. And this is one of the rare cases that by far the best performance was actually randomly just out of sample. So it was popular. You know, it's funny, the first version of the paper, I look back at it, I was reading the other day and we did this retrospective. And you being a kind of quant nerd like me would really appreciate it because it had much more in-depth statistical, like I was talking about skew and kurtosis and all this other stuff. And then I said, no one cares about that. Let's simplify it down to the very core. And listeners, if you haven't read this paper, it's nothing more than a long-term moving average. So it was the 10-month simple moving average, which is essentially the monthly equivalent of the 200-day moving average. But we're late on. We're late on asset classes. And so we used five, but you can use many more. And future versions of the papers had many, many derivations. But my favorite ribbing I like to give my wife, who did her Ph.D. in German philosophy, is I used to joke with her. And this is being very self-deprecating, by the way. Don't want to sound like a total a-hole. But I used to always kid her because there's nothing more academic than being a Ph.D. in philosophy. But I used to always say, you know, this is the most. I downloaded paper on the academic database. And she'd turn bright red and get angry and kick me in the shin. But, I mean, look, so much in our world of finance, the people that get anointed the kind of kings of the world are people that try to forecast with a lot of conviction. And then if an event happens, they become immensely popular. So we can name dozens of these people in history. And eventually, you know, the. Their time comes and goes and they start to get things wrong. And then the next one comes along and calls the next crash and they get it right or or whatever it may be. So you can look back over the years and there's so many of them. And obviously there's an element of that shine which people said, oh, he built this model that, you know, did this. And look, so much of it was luck. So much of his timing that having been said, you know, in this ensuing 10 years, you've seen all sides of it. You've seen when and why it underperforms, when and why it outperforms or not. And there's still a lot of. Miss. Conceptions about trend following in general that you probably get all the time, too.

      " So you actually touched on two topics I wanted to veer into. So I'll hit the first, which is you did just publish your version two, your retrospective, a decade plus of out of sample experience with the model. And I want to get a sense from you. What were the surprising lessons learned in the decade since publishing?\n",
      "所以你实际上触及了我想转向的两个主题.所以我会击中第一个,就是你刚刚出版了你的第二个版本,你的回顾,十多年与模型之间的样本经验.我想从你那里得到一个感觉.从出版以来的十年里,有哪些令人惊<unk>的教训?\n",

      " I think if you look at trend following in general and you have enough respect for history, you probably wouldn't be surprised by anything that's happened this decade. And I think the surprise for a lot of people is they misunderstanding trend following in general. So when you say trend following, it can mean a hundred different things. It's like saying, you know, dog, where one's a St. Bernard and one's a beagle. There's a huge difference between those species. You say trend following, it could mean anything from what we just talked about, which is kind of that time series momentum where you're in or out of a market. So if you're above the long-term moving average, you're investing the S&P. If you're below it, you're out. That's very simple, but there's so many other flavors of it. You know, the CTAs typically are long short. So they short a lot of markets, whereas ours just moved the cash. So it has very different outcomes. And so something like the system we're describing that I published would have been flat in 08, maybe up a little bit, maybe down a little bit, but something like a CTA would have been up 30. So it's so different. Same general. Description. So I think the surprise for most people that understand trend following is that, by and large, that sort of binary in-out, everyone wants it to be an outperformance sort of strategy where you're getting a lot higher compound returns because you're picking market tops and bottoms, and that's not how it works. Trend following particularly works because you get the majority meat of a move. You're never going to pick the bottom exactly. You're never going to pick the top exactly. By definition. So really when it works best is these long trending markets. And so it's actually worked great as applied just to say S&P 500, the cycle, because it's been a very long trending market. But in general, you don't really outperform. What you do is you reduce the volatility. You reduce the really big drawdowns. And for so many people, that's an important behavioral component. Psychological component of staying invested is if you look back to the 1920s, 30s, U.S. stocks. You find over 80%. And how many people can sit that? Very few. And people say, wow, that was a Great Depression. It doesn't happen. Well, I say, all right, well, look around to Greece and Russia and Cyprus and a gazillion other places. It's happened in the last 20 years. And it does happen. So I don't know that there's anything that's been a big surprise. I think the behavioral component, we can get into this at some point, too, of buy and hold investing is tough for many reasons. And it works great. Trend following is tough for a whole other set of reasons. And it also works well. So I think you've seen the full cycle of all the warts and benefits and everything in between.\n",

      " Oh boy, there's a lot. So we actually added, we ended up adding FAQs because we got so many of the questions over and over again. And your point is funny because being a quant, the rules are black and white. That's the whole point. And one of the biggest challenges of a trend following approach or any active approach, buy and hold is nice because you do nothing by definition. Trend following, because if you're running it on your own, it introduces break points, which are every time you have to make a trade, you have to make a decision. I mean, you shouldn't be if you follow the rules, it's black and white. And some people have struggled with that. And some people it's second nature. So it's funny. I used to get people email me all the time and say, Meb, hey, I noticed like the REITs, they only close like 1% below the moving average. So should I wait, you know, probably till next month? I decided, you know, it's not that big of a deal. I'm going to wait till next month. And they start to introduce all of these discretionary inputs of their emotions and interests. And I'm like, well, I'm going to wait till next month. And they and biases and it defeats the whole purpose, right? And because so many times, when you're doing trend following, particularly at the end of long moves, where something starts to roll over, if you think about REITs back in 07, you're like, Oh, man, we really want to sell REITs right now everything's ripping. I don't maybe I'll wait a month or same thing in back March of 2009. You know, the trend following probably didn't enter until the next month or the following. But man, this looks like a Great Depression. Everyone I know has lost their job. Lehman has gone under all these banks have gone. I, I'm just going to wait until, you know, things start to get a little better. And then again, next thing you know, it defeats the whole purpose of the system. So that's a big one. Then, of course, there's the people just straight up, I get emails say, Hey, man, I was following your 300 day moving average system every week. And where you publish, you know, I said, Whoa, we didn't publish any of this stuff. The good news is there's a million different derivations, you could take it. And we always said to people said, Look, a lot of people struggle with the binary outcomes, I need to be in or out. So we often said, Hey, you could average across three or four different moving averages, you could update it weekly, you could do half monthly, you could do like a gazillion different things to start to eliminate some of these emotional problems. Over the years, there's been some evolution of my thinking about how it fits into a portfolio. I used to always say trend following is my desert island strategy. But that's evolved a bit over the years. But yeah, I mean, it the biggest problem with investing across the board is people. And so we've had one of our largest investors, like you mentioned, entered a trend following program at probably the worst month in the past decade, and exited on arguably one of the worst months to have exited for rolling performance. And you know, we used to do some articles. If anyone reads those celebrity rags you see at the grocery store, US no celebrity weekly, I can't remember the names of them. But they have a section they're like celebrities, they're just like us, where they'll show Britney Spears getting coffee or whatever. And so we used to write an article called institutions, they're just like us, where these billion dollar institutions and advisors, they make the same mistakes, often chasing performance. And it's hard, I sympathize with it. But we've seen it particularly in the trend following space. Now that having been said, and I was talking with with Jerry Parker about this, who's been doing this for much longer than I have. And he said, you know, Meb, look, if you close your eyes, if you plug trend following into a mean variance optimizer, and you simply look at any of the indexes, any of the strategies, styles, you end up with a pretty heavy allocation to a trend following fund. How many advisors in the country allocate more than just a fraction, most of them zero to a trend following strategy? Almost none. Now, if you really want to get deep, and I'm totally straying off your question, but the definition of passive investing market cap weighted indexes, so think about the S&P 500, we're investing based on stocks just based on size. That's a trend following index, because the only input is price, you're investing more stocks go up, less as stocks go down. That's the ultimate trend following index. A lot of people don't like to hear that, particularly, you know, any of the buying holders. But by definition, that is literally the definition of a momentum or trend following index. So anyway, so yeah, there's people love to the fiddle, the doctors and engineers are the worst, I can say that I'm an engineer. But those are those are by far the worst investors because they know enough to be dangerous. I don't know if that's your experience, but it's definitely mine.\n",

      " You know, like almost everyone, it's a journey. I was a biotech guy in college, late 90s, internet bubble, biotech bubble. I was trading stocks from my dorm room, making tons of money, losing tons of money. Started out as a fundamental equity analyst in the biotech space, which is pretty tough because you have incredible binary outcomes, or even some of the smartest scientists will get it wrong. Many of them are kind of coin flips, but gravitate to be more and more quantitative. And I would like to think that I'm pretty honest, and this is a phrase that's getting used a lot, but evidence-based, where I try to soak up as much history, understanding of what possibly works, but have a common sense bent to it. And unlike a lot of people in our world, I actually think there's plenty of investment strategies that work just fine. If you tell me that your cousin is totally happy sitting in... CDs, awesome. If your uncle is a dividend guy and likes clipping dividend coupons, totally fine. I have what I think is my optimized best ideas all into one kind of bucket that we can get to. But over the years, to me, it's meant a lot of different things. And as I get older, I'm optimizing more and more on less headache, an outcome that will hopefully work. And any market environment, something that I think is balanced and hopefully benefiting from a lot of the ideas and mistakes that I made early. I mean, like many investors, you can be lucky enough to blow up a trade when you're young because that'll teach you a lot of lessons. And mine certainly happened in my 20s where I was eating mustard sandwiches for a year, trading options, which is a great way to blow up, by the way. And so... You know, there's an evolution and a journey for a lot of people. And I laugh because I talk to friends. I say, man, I think most people probably just be totally fine and buying the global market portfolio and move on with their life. But for me, it's meant, you know, some of the really boring stuff ends up, I think, mattering a lot more than people think. Stuff like fees and taxes. So evolution has kind of come full circle. I can kind of tell you where we've arrived at at the finish line. Unless you have some... Some more questions along the way.\n",

      " So to me, to every person, the starting point should always be the global market portfolio. So that's you go buy the world of publicly available investment assets. And that doesn't include a lot of real estate, doesn't include a lot of farmland, some other stuff that's private. But in general, if you buy the world of stocks and bonds and things like that, you end up with a portfolio of the world that's roughly half stocks and half bonds-ish. Which I'm rounding because it's simpler. And some stuff like corporate bonds is really a mix of the two. So the exposure probably looks a little more stock heavy. And of that, it's about half U.S., half foreign. And so almost no one has that portfolio. And almost in every country around the world, people put way too much in their own market. So in the U.S., of the stock allocation, they put about 70% in the U.S. Our Italian friends do the same thing. Our Aussie, British, Japanese buddies all do the same thing. Put way too much in their own market. It's called home country bias. And could it work out? Sure. But usually it's a pretty horrible, uncompensated idea. But so to me, that's the starting point. If you want to deviate from there, great. And you want to make active bets from there, great. But that's, to me, always the starting point. That historically has done 9%, 10% a year returns, similar volatility, big fat drawdown. You can't really do anything to get around that. And one of the challenges, too, is 99.9% of investors think in terms of nominal returns, meaning before inflation. But that's a big apples to oranges comparison over history because there's been time in the U.S. when inflation is high single digits, potentially even low double digits. Right now it's, what, 2%? Some countries it gets even much higher, much lower. But to say a 10% return in the time of 8% inflation, you only really made 2% returns, returns you can eat. Whereas now, if you had a 4% return and 2% inflation, it's the same thing. But it's hard for people to think in those terms. It's hard to compare it over time. It's a lot simpler to work with nominal. And that has a lot of repercussions. We can get that later. But one of the points being, if you look back over history, is that it's really, really, really hard to pick a portfolio, on a buy and hold basis, that doesn't decline at least 25% after inflation. And a lot of people say, man, but what are you talking about? Look at bonds, bonds over the past year. There's no, we did this Twitter poll, which I'm sure you probably saw, where we said, you know, how much did you think bonds declined after inflation? 10 year bonds or long term bonds? I said zero to 10, 10 to 20, you know, yada, yada, all the way down 50 plus. And by far, most people said zero to 10. What's the answer? It's over. 50% because inflation is the biggest risk for bonds. It's kind of that slow erosion, whereas stocks, it's kind of that crash risk.\n",

      " It's tough, you know, and so a lot of people, the conclusion they often come to is, hey, look, if bonds have 50% drawdowns and they have much lower returns, why not just put all your money in stocks? And the problem is stocks also are super volatile and they also have huge drawdowns. And so the combination of two, because they're not perfectly correlated, is usually a bit better. And then you also got to think globally, because there's examples of global bond markets that essentially lost all their value. If you think about Japan or Germany or any countries that went through hyperinflation. But the same thing can be said about stock markets. Russian and Chinese markets closed up shop totally in the 20th century. So you lost all your money. So there's no reason in my mind not to take a totally balanced approach. U.S. is one of the best performing capital markets of the 20th century, no question. Would anyone have predicted that in 1899? Maybe. Chances are they might have liked Argentina too, and you would have lost a bunch of money there. So diversifying, it makes a lot of sense. And if you want a little historical, we love saying, there's a rule of thumb that after inflation, global stocks should return. Historically, they have returned about 5%. Bonds, if you round up, about 2%. And bills, about 1%. Now, where it starts to get interesting is you say, all right, well, what about all the other stuff? Tax class allocation and models like that. And I think they can offer a lot of value, like the trend following stuff we talked about. And so we've kind of settled, for me personally, is this Trinity portfolio concept you talked about, you mentioned, which is half of the allocation in buy and hold. And within that, you still want to do some things that make sense. That will get you 90% of their, just your asset allocation. But should you tilt towards value away from a market cap weighting? Yes. So is it worth doing? Yes. Should you add a little momentum in those indices? Yes. That probably makes sense too. So kind of adding better indexing or better... Better strategies other than market cap weighting, basically anything other than market cap weighting. And then the other half of the portfolio is, for me, is the trend following portfolio. And that can mean a few different things. We use numerous funds in that allocation to diversify, but I think that the trend following, both of those are equally hard to comply with. But I think having one foot as an anchor in the fundamental world of buy and hold lets you not be too different from your neighbor. It gives you a good, return stream. You own assets that historically pay you. You're equity heavy. That's great. But on the flip side, you have the trend following component that if and when you have a monster long bear market, at least you have something that's zigging and zagging, hopefully, and something that hopefully protects you a little bit or a lot bit. And it gives you that feeling of at least you're trying to do something. I think a lot of people really struggle with buy and hold when you're not doing anything. I think that of all the G7 countries, I don't know of one that hasn't had a two-thirds, 60-40 allocation drawdown on a real basis ever. And how many clients can sit through a 60% drawdown? Not many.\n",

      " There was a good Jim O'Shaughnessy thread that kind of went viral this week, which you can link to in your show notes for listeners. And there was a place, and I'm going to paraphrase because I'll murder this, but he said something along those lines of, and the listeners, if you're not familiar, Jim is kind of old school quant. I mean, he wrote the Bible on. He's one of the godfathers. The godfather. I mean, he's on the Mount Rushmore. You know, wrote a book about equity screen, factor-based quant screening that he probably shouldn't have written because he gave away a lot of the keys. And then he even named it What Works on Wall Street. Yeah, but then again, he got to go on Oprah for that, so it's a tradeoff. Would you give away all your secrets to be on Oprah? But he had a tweet that he said something like, you know, here's all the things I've learned, and this is what I believe, and this is what I strongly believe. But, like, am I certain? And it's, you know, he's like, no. I believe that these things work, and I have reasons, and it makes sense, but, you know, the future. The future is uncertain. And then Zweig had a kind of similar quote. He said something like, the future is a storm of which you're getting blown into backwards. And I just love that. That's like my every day, I feel like, is a storm I'm getting blown into backwards. So there's a lot of things I believe in. I mean, look, do I believe in ultra-low-cost buy-and-hold investing, that taxes and fees matter? Absolutely. Do I think the vast majority of the money management industry charges way too much for buy-and-hold investing? Yes. Do I believe that there are plenty of brilliant investors and hedge funds and private equity and angel investors that are worth their weight in gold? Absolutely. Do I rail against financial advisors that charge too much and do nothing? Yes. Do I believe that financial advisors are worth their weight in gold for what they do if they do offer value-added services like estate planning and taxes and insurance and behavioral coaching? Absolutely. 1% is probably not. It's not enough. So it's a little bit complicated. There's a lot of areas where a little bit of knowledge, like real estate. If you're a local real estate investor and you have a huge amount of value-added knowledge and you know that that house in the corner, somebody got murdered in the basement and the one next door has chemical poisoning in the basement and the one next door has asbestos, that's a value-added knowledge. And the same thing exists in our world where there's so many potential advantages and differences. But I think the thing I believe in... I believe in most is, one, being a student of history. So trying to soak up as much knowledge of what's happened in the past, what's worked, what hasn't worked, what's the really dumb mistakes to make. And the biggest compliment you can give any money manager in our entire world is simply that they survived. So you went back and looked at the blog. And I actually did this a year or two ago because it hit its 10-year anniversary. And I said, I'm going to go back and read every blog post. And on top of that, I went and clicked on all the links. Let's call it half are defunct. And half the money management shops, gone. Half the startups that I had linked to or cool ideas or websites, gone. Three-quarters of the bloggers. You know, everyone thought writing, hey, I'm going to be a blogger, tried it for about a month. It's like, oh my God, that's so much work. I'm not going to do that anymore. So just surviving is tough in our world. And if you look at... I mean, 2017, by the way, was a... A graveyard for all-star hedge fund money managers. I mean, so many just gave up. Like, they just had years and years of underperformance. And so I think a lot of what applies to our world of professional management, but also investors, is you just want to stay in the game. And so many people that... We recently put out a podcast. And by the time this comes out, it should be out, a piece on what we call the food pyramid, of investing. Whereas what we knew 40 years ago about food pyramid, if you look to the bottom of the food pyramid, older listeners will remember this. Younger people, there's this USDA-recommended diet where it said at the bottom was... It was like bread, muffins, carbs, and cereal. It was like 11 servings a day. And I don't care what diet. You're probably on a keto diet.\n",

      " So you got to remember that the best investment strategy is the one that works for you. And so we were tweeting the other day and we said, I was like, followers, find me an asset class or an allocation that on a real basis has declined less than 25%. It's basically impossible. And a lot of people would be surprised by this. They say, what do you mean, man? I put my money in CDs. I said, remember, after inflation. And cash is lost about half after inflation at one point. And so it's tough. And so, you know, a lot of people, they kind of think in two buckets. The get rich portfolio and the stay rich portfolio. And a lot of people that are used to the get rich portfolio don't transition well to the other. A good example is the tycoon in Brazil. I'm going to murder his name, like Batista or something. At one point he got to $25 billion. And now I think he's equivalently at zero because concentration risk, which is what gets you rich, you know, and leverage. Those are horrible on the downside. And so, you know, there's a great deal of money. And I think that's a great old phrase is once you get to a certain point, you know, realize you've won the game and you don't have to do the same thing. So Trinity was a concept where I said, look, I want to put everything possible into one holistically into a bucket. And then on top of that, you know, if you want to dial it down with more bonds, more cash, you can go one way. You want to get more aggressive. You can go the other way. You can customize it to your heart's content. To me, that's kind of where I've arrived at. But again, I'm honest that there's other ways. And the challenge is you look around the world and we're of the opinion that U.S. stocks are pretty expensive now. I don't think they're a bubble, but they're expensive. And historically, that sets you up for larger drawdowns and a higher possibility of a big fat drawdown. And so having a balanced portfolio and even having a fair amount of cash, too, is always erring on the side of less risk. I think is important. You know, it's funny because so much of what people invest in is colored by the personal experience. My mom, love her to death. One of the best investors I know. But her experience was she invested during the 80s and 90s. Her father worked for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, one of the best performing stocks of all time. So her experience is colored by that. And she's always telling me growing up, which is actually good advice. But you buy stocks, put them away, you hold them forever, which is good advice in general. But if you're someone in Greece or Russia or Brazil, you may not think that's such good advice. If your parents worked for Enron, you may not think that's such good advice or CMGI or Pest.com or yada yada on and on. So, so much of it gets colored by your personal experience. So my allocation and this is where it starts to get fun and philosophical. And let me give you an example. Let's call it. I don't know. Somewhere between 50 and 99 percent of my. Net worth is my company. So I was riding a chairlift with a buddy once and having this discussion and say, look, my public portfolio of investments compared to this. It's not a rounding error, but it's small. So if you think about it, you can make the argument one of two ways. And I think both are actually quite valid. One, because your entire outcome will be determined by this company. You should take. As much risk in that public portfolio because it's not going to matter because it's going to be determined by the company's outcome. You could also make the argument that because your allocation is going to be dominated by your interest in your company, why take any risk at all? You should take no risk in your, in your portfolio.\n",

      " It's even worse for people that work for, say, Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley as a wire house. And so we called it something like, if you're a financial advisor, you're four times levered to the stock market. Because one, you probably have your own personal portfolio in stocks. Second, and you may, even if you're a moron, have your retirement in your company's stock. You should never do that. Two, is that your employer, again, your client's portfolios, your revenue is tied to the market size. Third is that if you work for a company that you don't own your own company, you're at the risk of getting fired in a downturn. So you just quadruple leverage the stock market. And if you think about that, and almost no one does this, but the same way the Southwest Airlines hedges their fuel costs, or, you know, a cereal company hedges their wheat cost, you could also make the argument that no financial advisor in the country should own stocks at all either, to smooth out their revenues. Or that they should consider some hedging with options, or consider some, like, strategies, trend following, other ideas. So that's the fun part about the philosophical side, because you could have inputs and add the emotions on top of that. So we've had, an example was a couple, they've come together to their risk scores, you know, they're moderate, but she can't handle anything more than a 5% drawdown and he can handle 80. So it's, you add those emotions together, that's, that's gonna create problems at some point. So part of it, that's part of the art of this world, and really comes down to what you're comfortable with. So I, my family, my dad's side grew up in Kansas and Nebraska. My dad grew up on a farm. I mean, no running water outhouse. Sort of thing. And we, and we still have a lot of family in Kansas. And so we have some wheat land, well, cropland in, in Western Kansas. Mostly grows wheat, but other crops too. And so when he passed away, we, the brothers inherited that. So we've kept that and that's at current wheat prices, basically like a T-bill investment. It's fun until like two years ago when we had a combine that, that burned down and then it becomes a huge pain, but a lot of fun, but it's a great diversifier. Farmland was actually one of the best performing. We've been doing asset classes of the two thousands until about a year or two ago until it got to like a P ratio of about 20. So for me, that's a big chunk. The public stuff is in the Trinity portfolios. And then personally I've been doing, and I have some interest in a, in another business started, but then angel investing. But to me, that's been something that I've been doing over the last five years. Cause I think it's fun. I consider it tuition. There's some behavioral benefits to that. That. Historically. I think a lot of people. Have considered to be. Negatives of the asset class, but the fact that you invest in a private business and there is no exit. So you, you exit when the business goes out of business or they pay some dividends or they get acquired or IPO and that's it. So the cool thing about that is you can't do anything you're stuck and there's some actual cool tax benefits. We don't probably don't have time to get into today. Newer tax benefits of, of private investments called QSBS. That you essentially can invest in them tax-free. That's pretty cool for taxable investors. So, you know, for some people they've arrived at a, at a totally different allocation for various reasons, but that ends up being mine.\n",

      " And as you know, as an investor, there's only so much we can control. Julian Robertson, who was the founder of Tiger, very famously said a young fund manager came up to him and said, hey, what's the best advice you can give a young manager starting out? And he said, and I'm paraphrasing, he said, be lucky and in the first year have fantastic returns. Because everyone's going to think you're a genius and money will just wash all over you. And unfortunately in our world, that's true. And how many times have you seen the managers get anointed, the most brilliant managers? My favorite example from the 2000s was, I think it was the fund manager of the decade by Morningstar in 2000s. I think it was Ken Huebner. And great, I mean, he did something like 12% a year. And that's awesome. Hugely different, sort of very concentrated guy. But the average investor in that fund didn't do 12%. It had like negative returns. Because they chased him after he had up 50% a year, then he had down 70% and they all sold. So it's hard. So you can only control so much of the flows. And we joke, so the tail risk fund, for example, I say, I think it's a great time to be allocating to it. That fund is only going to see flows after the event, probably. As after it goes up 10, 20, 50%, then everyone's going to buy it, much to their detriment. But I can't really control that. So be lucky, that's the first part. But. You know, for us, we have about four criteria when launching a fund. The first for me is it has to be something that no one else has launched or we think we can do a lot better or cheaper. Cheaper is a little more rare in a world of five basis points, but it does happen every once in a while. Second has to be something I want to put my own money into. And lastly, and this is kind of the hard part is it has to be something that, you know, there's enough evidence for that it works. It makes sense. Hopefully there's a lot of academic literature about it. It's common sense. You could probably explain it to your niece or nephew. Lastly, and this is the hardest one for me is always, is it anything anyone wants? And we have some ideas that I think are just awesome. And I guarantee you not a single person on the planet is going to want it. A good example is we wrote a paper where we basically demonstrated that a taxable investor should never invest in high dividends. And that's not going to happen. They're not going to invest in high dividend stocks because they're going to get hammered with taxes. So their after tax return is lower than the S&P. Well, imagine the hate mail from that. So I said a better solution because dividends are essentially a value tilt and not particularly a good one is if you're going to do value, just do value. And so do a value strategy that avoids high dividend stocks. And so picture the potential investors in that one. We're going to launch a no or low yielding fund. Come on. But if you're an honest person after tax basis, even if that fund kept up with the S&P after taxes, it's a much better investment. And with the value tilt, it should be better than the S&P. So listeners, if you got a 20 million, $20 million seed, you want to launch that. Let me know. Talk to me. But that's an example of, you know, and the flip side is so many of my good friends, so many buddies of ours in the industry, you know, launch funds that are. I mean, you could. You could say they're fun. A lot of thematics. But are they in the best interest of the investor? Probably not. And we had a scenario this past January where we could have and we could still be the first to do it. Launch a Bitcoin futures fund. And there's like, I don't know, 12 in registration. Right. And so there's a little workaround where we could be the first one to market and that would raise a billion dollars. There's no question. And I said, you know, it's just not it's not really my thing. It's not my brand. I don't own it. I wouldn't own it. I don't know. So it's challenging because there's in our industry, you have kind of two different types of firms, the ones that. Historically, you know, will charge as much as possible and get away with it. There's S&P 500 mutual fund that charges two point three percent, which is the same thing you can get for five basis points. And it literally has S&P 500 in the name. Right. X Guggenheim. I'm talking to you. But there's plenty of the charge above a percent percent and a half. And who owns those? It's people that have either died or forgotten or have been sold and don't know better. And that's predatory. Anyway, getting off topic. So those are kind of the criteria. And so when you're building a firm in our early days, believe me, when we just had one or two funds out and they were long only equity. Yeah. Yeah. That was not a good sleep at night situation for me. Now, I sleep at night anyway. So that's not a good analogy. But having that exposure made me very nervous because because as a risk manager and you're I'm sure the same way as I could spend all night spinning my wheels, think of the thousand different outcomes of what can happen. And a good example as a good investor, as a better, you know, you got to think in terms of all the possible outcomes. So you sit down a blackjack table and there's the guy at the end of the table. You know, you're at the end of the table. And you're at the end of the table. And you're at the end of the table. So you know, the dealer has a six card and the guy somehow has like a 17 and hits it anyway, but still gets a four and says, I told you so. See, so, you know, how many people go back to the last president's inauguration would have predicted the first year in history with 12 months in the row in the stock market? Zero. But we saw it. And so that's on a positive surprise. But of course, you get the negative, too. So having long only exposure was very nervous for me. But now I'm much happier with. Somewhat of a blended outcome. But going back to your way earlier point, the biggest risk is still.\n",

It was still as the U.S. stock market outperformed. It was number one country in the world from 2009 to about 2015, which has basically never happened for that long of a stretch. It's very, very rare. U.S. versus foreign is basically a coin flip. And 2014, we launched it and it kept going down. And then since then has been just on fire outperforming, but it's very, very concentrated. And you're going to look very, very different. So a funny part is I often say to people, I say, look, if you're a value investor, it's equally important to be invested in the cheap stuff. But it's as important to be avoiding the really expensive, you know, so making not making the dumb mistake of being invested in the U.S. now or at least really overweight or invested in China and India in the mid 2000s. Remember the bricks? Everyone's marketing the bricks. Yeah. Brazil, Russia, India and China in the mid 2000s. China and India were trading a P ratios of 40 to 60, not investing in the U.S. in the late 90s, not investing in Japan. The biggest bubble we've ever seen in the 80s at P ratio of 100. So the main gist of that strategy is is value investing. And it's simple. And it's so funny going back to our old trend following conversation where people want to complicate. They say, Meb, well, shouldn't you be updating this quarterly? Can you send me the valuation metrics every month? I say. It doesn't matter. Actually, the more you rebalance the strategy, the worse it gets. It actually hurts it. A value strategy to rebalance it more often when it's that such deep value. And so thinking about that and the implementation of complexity, I think most important for investors is that concept of storytelling. And so thinking of products, I prefer they to be as simple as possible. But I think getting it wrapped around someone's head with. OK, I get it. I like the story. That's as humans. That's how we interact. So I could tell you statistically why high dividend stocks have zero chance against a shareholder yield strategy going forward. And the same reason that they've gotten pummeled by a shareholder yield strategy the last four years. But is that the good story? No. The good story is, hey, think about dividends is only part of the picture. You think about a way a company. Distributes their cash like Apple, which is a great case study, just announced 100 billion in buybacks. And people can start to understand that. Again, the litmus test for me, which is not the case for most fund companies, is I invest in all of our funds. I want to invest in our funds. And usually that's why we launch them is because there's nothing exists. The tail risk fund. There's no fun like it. And going back to what you're talking about, I said, I want a way that me personally and our company. So not only do I own the tail risk fund, our company owns it as a way. And it's been a terrible investment. And I hope it continues to be a terrible investment and loses money every year for the next ten years. The same way that my car insurance and my house insurance lose money. I am totally fine with that. In fact, that's the best case scenario because that means everything else is making money. So my biggest criteria is I want to invest in it. And for me, complexity for complexity's sake is not the end goal. Last question. Man, come on. I feel like we got another hour or two. Easy. We can keep going. Our studio turns into a sauna here. So I've about sweated through both of my shirts because we usually have to turn the fan down because it gets too noisy.\n",

Corey Hofstein is the co-founder and chief investment officer of Newfound Research. Due to industry regulations, he will not discuss any of Newfound Research's funds on this podcast.

This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a basis for investment decisions. Clients of Newfound Research may maintain positions and securities discussed in this podcast. For more information, visit thinknewfound.com. In this episode, I chat with Toby Carlisle, a managing member at Carbon Beach Asset Management and author of popular value investing books such as Deep Value and The Acquirer's Multiple. Toby's approach to value investing evolved from his observations as a corporate lawyer in Australia during the burst of the dot-com bubble. Watching investors target cash-rich but business-poor dot-com companies confused his traditional discounted cash flow mentality. But after watching these activists get their hands dirty, Toby realized that even bad companies can be attractive if they're trading at a deep discount to liquidation value. In our conversation, we navigate a wide range of topics, including uses and limits of quantitative investing in the realm of special situations, how under the right circumstances even Apple can be a deep value stock, and why using the opposite of your investment signal to build a short book might be a bad idea. Without further ado, please enjoy my conversation with Toby Carlisle. Toby, thank you for joining me today. Thanks for having me, Corey. So let's start at the beginning for you, man. Clearly, not born and raised in America with that Australian accent. Why don't you give us a story of how you came to live states?\n",

There was more cash than sort of inventory, which might be hard to sell. Maybe the inventory should be written down by this amount because it's not worth anything anymore. I got to the end of 2009 after the market had recovered. And I looked at the returns of the ones that I had picked out and they did really well. It was like 250% over that year in the course of these ones that I had identified and cherry picked out. And I thought, I'm really good at this stuff. And then I thought just to torture myself, I'll go and look at what the entire cohort of whatever it was, 250 or 350 stocks that I bought 30 say out of that group. So pretty selective, less than a decile. What did the whole cohort? The cohort did 750%. So how did I mess that up so badly? That was the thought that I had. Basically, you get a handful of stocks that go up 20, 50 times. And if you don't catch those ones that perform like that, you underperform. And that's basically quant investing. You need a bigger portfolio because you're going to get this right tail of returns and you need to capture those returns.\n",

      " Yeah, that was the beginning of the journey. I read James Montier, great value investor and value kind of philosopher, had written this great piece called An Ode to Quant. And I read that and I saw in there that he said that there was this phenomenon in social studies, which is pretty pronounced. Basically, the idea is that simple statistical models, simple algorithms outperform the intuition of the best experts, which sounds nuts. But it's common. You find this over and over again in the literature. And I think in 1975, Paul Meal, who's regarded as the godfather of this area of studies, said something like, when you see these studies over and over again reporting the same result, at some stage, you have to sort of acknowledge that this is a phenomenon, that our behavior in these things is sort of deleterious to our expertise. And it's not just in investing, it's in selecting wine vintages, determining which criminal... Is it going to be recidivists, college admissions? It's over and over again, all of these different areas where we just, we fool ourselves. So the classic example is a story where a Professor Goldberg, who was a, I think he was a psychologist, and he was looking at when people present in a hospital, if your schizophrenia and very deep depression can manifest the same way, there's a little bit of psychosis in the deep depression. And it can be very difficult to determine whether somebody who's having some sort of, you know, ideation that is a little not connected to reality, and someone who's schizophrenic is not connected to reality. So he came up with this six question framework, and he asked people these questions. And then subsequently, when they were treated, down the track, two weeks or a month later, they were able to make a diagnosis, a proper diagnosis. And then they could go back and look at the way that they presented initially and determine, was our initial diagnosis correct or not? And they had students ask these six questions and make a diagnosis based on the six questions. Then they gave it to treating clinicians, and they had them do the same thing, but they didn't have to follow the recommendation. So they found that basically the clinicians who applied this rule got better results than people who didn't apply this sort of questionnaire. But they found that the questionnaire by itself, which was applied by the students without fear or favour, outperformed the best clinicians, even with the benefit of the questionnaire. So somebody with years and years of experience, presumably, doing this stuff all the time, with the benefit of the questionnaire, which is guiding them in the right direction, still doesn't do as well as this dumb six question questionnaire. And that's something that you see over and over again as a quant. The reason why this happens is this idea, the broken leg theory. So the broken leg theory is best explained in the story, the way it's described in literature. You have this quant model that determines whether an individual goes to theatre on a Friday night. And you might include. And that quant model thinks like, is it raining outside that might stop them from going? Is it an action movie which this person prefers or is it a romance movie which they don't want to see? So you have your six factors in your quant model. And then you learn on one Friday that the person has a broken leg. And do you therefore override the model to allow for the fact that a broken leg might mean you're less likely to go to the theatre? Or do you then follow the model which doesn't have that information in it? And the answer is that you have to keep on following the model. And the.

      " side. I'm born and raised in Australia. Grew up in a little country town way in the outback. One of my subjects at school was how to shear sheep. This is a real thing. They talk about ring banging the bush mob. That means cutting some of the hair on the tail so you can distinguish the cows in this instance, the cattle that have been treated, knocking the horns off, branding them. Went to university and I did business and then law school. Went to work in a law firm in Australia doing mergers and acquisitions. My first day of work was April 2000. The dot-com had peaked or was literally just about to peak. I thought I had been brought in to do IPOs of tech companies because that was what everybody was doing at that stage. I thought that was really interesting. They just disappeared. There was no means of raising money anymore. There were lots of mergers and acquisitions though because that was the turn of the market. Companies are still buying other companies. It was just a very interesting time. I think that's what I've been doing. I've been doing a lot of happy coincidence that it was at this time. There were these new investors who were doing interesting things. One of the things they were doing was targeting these companies that were dot-coms that raised a whole lot of money but had this cash burn. They were literally selling $10 widgets for $20 and losing $10 in every sale and trying to make it up on volume. I had read in college Buffett's letters and I'd forced myself to sit down and read the 1934 edition of security analysis, which is really, really dry. It's mostly about railway bonds, which I don't think there are any publicly traded railways in Australia at the time. I'd be hard-pressed to find very many in the States too. These guys were targeting these busted companies that were terrible businesses. I was trying to apply my Buffett return on invested capital. Buffett prefers these wonderful businesses at fair prices. They're trying to apply that to these businesses. You just can't do a DCF on something that's losing money. You end up with this negative value. These guys were buying these things, couldn't quite figure out what they were doing. Eventually, I realized this is one of those examples of a little bit of understanding about something actually makes it really hard to understand what's actually going on. The Buffett stuff did not help. Basically, these guys wanted the cash on the balance sheet. That raised a whole lot of money. They're trading a big discount to that cash. There's no reason why these things are ordained to lose money forever and ever. If you get in and stop that silly business, then you've got valuable assets. You've got to be able to get in and stop that silly business. You bought it at a big discount. Then you can keep on doing that. We didn't know what they were called at the time. I subsequently become activists, but there was no name for them at the time. I collected a lot of information, became very interested in it, became a little part of the practice. Mostly, it was defense because we were working for bigger clients. These guys were mostly young guys who had little hedge funds who were being obnoxious to try and draw attention to the fact that these things were so cheap. I went back to the security analysis later chapters in two of these chapters back to back. One talks about buying at the discount to liquidation value, and the other one talks about shareholder rights. That was what started me down the path towards deep value investment.\n",

      " tell us. I keep on telling that story. I'm happy to hear from whoever coined it. The reason that I describe it the way that I do and the way that I found it, Buffett talks about operating income. He regularly talks about operating EBIT operating income as the way that Buffett describes it. So it's an apples to apples comparison of correcting for the capital structure, looking at interest and taxes and adding those things back in. So you're looking at basically the accounting definition of cash flows that's coming into the business. And then on the other hand, you're looking at enterprise value, which is market capitalization, lets you know what the equity is worth. Enterprise value includes other things that an acquirer of the business really has to pay. And that's, they have to find a way to service the debt or pay out the debt. If there are any preference shares in there, they have to find a way to service them or pay them off, minority interests, other things like that. So these are real costs an acquirer of the business has to pay. So those two metrics together give you a good idea of what the residue of the business that you're actually paying for is. And then what you're getting in return in terms of operating income. Buffett has been a long term value investor whose value investment has sort of evolved over time from, he was probably a deep value investor in the more of Graham. And by virtue of meeting Charlie Munger and reading Phil Fisher, he became a more sort of growth quality franchise, high return on invested capital type investor. So Joel Greenblatt wrote a wonderful book that came out in 2006 called The Little Book That Beats the Market. And in there, he advocates for this metric that he calls the magic formula. On one hand, it uses the acquirer's multiple EBIT operating income on enterprise value. And on the other hand, it uses return on invested capital. And the idea of return on invested capital is you're looking for how much profit does this company generate for how much money is invested in it. And the more profitable it is per dollar invested in it, the better the business is, which makes perfect sense because that kind of business can compound at a very high rate. And so that's what we're looking for. And then you've got to look at the return on invested capital rate. It can become very, very profitable with sort of marginal investment in it. And when you combine that with a value factor, you're getting these very high quality, high compounding kind of businesses at a cheap price. So Greenblatt tested in the book over 12 years or something like that, and it worked well. We tested it again. So quantitative value, which came out in 2012, Wes Gray and I tested that and found that that does in fact beat the market, even doing stuff like it's not a small company effect. Limit yourself to the biggest companies in the market. If you then market capitalization weight those companies, you still outperform the market capitalization weighted index. So it's a very, very good metric. In the course of doing that, I thought, how is it that return on invested capital metric stands up so well? Because my own personal experience of buying these companies is that you're buying companies at the very pinnacle of their business cycle and you see mean reversion in the profitability. So you buy something that looks really cheap, you acquire as multiple metric and it looks really good, but the mean reverse is that you buy something that looks really cheap and reversion in the return on invested capital and the profitability, they become less cheap and less good in the period after you own them. And so I thought, what if we just tested this without looking at the profitability metric? What does that do? Just randomize that error rather than focus on that error. And it turns out you do better in a raw performance sense and in a risk adjusted sense, which is the most surprising thing. So the reasons are mostly it's that return on invested capital identifies these companies right at the pinnacle of their business cycle. So you're encouraging competitors from adjacent industries to come in and compete away for those dollars, which just makes sense. There aren't very many free lunches in the market. And on the other hand, the very worst companies, you can think about many industries that have beaten up people in the industry leave because it's so hard to make money or they do it forcibly because they just bankrupted. And it creates this period where there's not very much capital in the industry. There's not very many businesses there. So when the oil price, say, comes back, if you want to access that, you've got to do it. And that's why I think it's so important to go through these oil field services companies that are left, the ones that were able to survive, and they have a period of super normal profitability. And I think that's the reason why not looking at the return on investment, just randomizing that error tends to do better than focusing on ROIC.\n",

      " Well, it's interesting to me, at least when I think about something like return on invested capital, it has this nice intuition to it, right? Where if you can buy a cheap company that can compound their growth at a faster rate, it's putting not only the valuation tailwinds in your sales, but all right, great. Let's say if it doesn't revalue, I'm still getting a fast compounder, but it does invite the question, at least to me, why is this fast compounder suddenly trading at a massive discount, right? What does the market know that I don't? And it does bring up your point that is this peak profitability for this company, or does it have a sustained moat? And I think Warren Buffett's approach would be, well, let's try to identify the companies that are high ROIC, that do have the sustained moat. Your viewpoint, not to put words in your mouth, but having read the acquirer's multiple is quite simply trying to identify those moats in a quantitative or even a qualitative manner is, in your experience, near impossible.

      " After I had done that research, I went back through and I read all of the letters. I've done that multiple times, read all of his letters. And every time I read them, I find something new that if I hadn't, I learned something and I go back and read it and I discover that Buffett knew it 50 years ago and he's been trying to explain it and I just didn't understand it the first time I read it. When you read his letters, what he's really saying is these are the economics of moats. We're not hunting for just return on invested capital. That's almost sort of a symptom of what we're hunting for, what we're hunting for. It's companies that have a moat. He says that over and over again and I'm a very slow learner, so I didn't really understand it. But he gives all of the letters he's talking about. These are the indicia of moats. So he has a way of identifying them. If you try to approach the, let's say you don't possess Buffett's genius, you need to find some sort of scientific or quantitative way of doing it. And I've been hunting for a smart way of doing that because that's a way to beat the market as well. If you look for the good ways of doing it, I think Michael Malbison has, the best sort of analysis of it. He's been running this experiment on an ongoing basis. Basically, he looks at a cohort of companies and then he tracks their return on invested capital forward over 10 years. And so he divides them into, take every company in the universe, the top 1,000 businesses, divide them into five groups. The first group has the very highest return on invested capital. The fifth group has the very lowest return on invested capital. And inevitably, they follow the same performance. The whole group is the same. The highest return on invested capital trends down towards the average. The lowest return on invested capital trends up towards the average. When you look at that as a group, what he's saying is basically return on invested capital is highly mean reverting. So how do you find the ones that resist that? About 4% of companies are able to sort of resist this and they have this every year. They turn out a pretty good return on invested capital that is better than the average. They're able to sustain that compound year after year after year. And the companies that aren't particularly glamorous, they're often companies that have, you know, so for a long time, P&G, they have these branded consumer goods that sit on supermarket shelves. Band-Aid, lots of things like that. Johnson & Johnson has lots of these little products that it doesn't cost them very much to make. They're able to sell them at a high margin. Everybody goes in. You're not going to buy a knockoff version of Band-Aid. You want the Band-Aid brand of Band-Aids. And so they're able to earn a pretty good return. And on the other side, it's also true. In the cohort that is the worst, that trends back to average, there is a group in there that are just set up to fail. You never want to buy the very worst return on invested capital. So they're the dot-coms that don't have a business model. They're the miners or the junior miners that don't have a deposit. They're sort of, they're using shareholder money to hunt for that deposit. If they strike it rich, they do well. But as a cohort, they don't do well. So they lose money on average. So return on invested capital on average is not a good metric. But the very worst are. Stocks that you want to avoid. Malverson has sort of looked at the ones that that 4% that are able to avoid the mean reversion. He's looked at that. He's devolved their returns using the DuPont analysis. Is it a high margin with a low turnover? Or is it a thin margin with a high turnover? It tends to be a higher margin with a lower turnover. Tends to be a better business. But he's not able to prospectively identify with each new cohort, which will be the ones that will resist mean reversion in the next 10 years.\n",

      " I think there are three broad camps of value investors. There are the guys who are doing special situations, who are looking for genuine arbitrages, so whether it's a risk arbitrage or they're looking for an undervalued security hard catalyst. I think that's a very valid way of investing and generates returns that are sort of uncorrelated to the market and they're always going to be very idiosyncratic. Their returns that can be good in one year, bad in another year, doesn't really matter what the market does. Then distinct from that is another group and they exist on a spectrum and one end of that spectrum is the Buffett franchise guys. So they will want to do a DCF. They're assuming a very high return on invested capital, rapid growth over an extended period of time so they have some sort of sustainable moat there. And I think that when they do an analysis, they do a DCF style analysis. I think they'll often find that the implied PE is quite high for those people. So they might buy something at 40 times earnings thinking that it's worth 60 times earnings. I know lots of guys who are like that in that kind of camp and I say that the ick, the gag factor, I'm buying the stuff that's very ugly when I'm buying it and I have to kind of ignore the recent track record or my own personal feelings about the business in order to buy them. What they have to ignore is the valuation. So they'll look at 40 times earnings sounds like an insane. That could be very depressed earnings in my world, but in their world that's compound. And that's a way to value the company. Like 40 times earnings is expensive, but they think that it's going to compound and that's going to eventually be proven to be a cheap multiple. And the examples that they give are often something like Walmart. You can go back to when Walmart IPO'd in 1975, something like that in the 70s. And you can look at what multiple would have given you just the market return since it IPO'd. And it's something like you could have paid up to a thousand times something like that off the Richter scale of what you would consider to be value. And it would have delivered just a market return, which is still a pretty good return over that period of time. So that's one end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is where I am, which is the deep value stocks. So these are companies that the business is questionable. There's not much business there. I think it's better than the market is giving it credit for, but I acknowledge that there are problems with the business. You're looking at a little bit of balance sheet value. Definitely not going to look at compounding. All of these things need to do for my strategy to work is for them to survive the next period of time and then to find that period of time. And that's the period where their world gets a little bit better because the competitors have left. The capital has kind of dried up. They're the last man or few companies left in that space. And with a little bit of a better environment for them, they'll start performing. And so when they do that, you get the improvement in intrinsic value of the business, and then you get a narrowing of the discount from price to intrinsic value. And those two things together deliver the returns in that group.\n",

      " Apple's a great example because it generates so much cash and that cash is largely built up on its balance sheet. In 2013, in a large cap world, it was one of the cheapest 10% of stocks around just by virtue of the fact that, and that's on using the acquirer's multiple to value it. So that was backing out the cash that it had sitting on its balance sheet. It wasn't carrying any meaningful debt or that wasn't seasonal or part of the business. And it was throwing off enormous amounts of operating cashflow. And so when you look at those two things together, it was a very cheap business. It seems to happen cyclically for Apple that it's between iPhone launches or something like that. People wonder whether that, is it really a franchise? Is it more of a tech company? Will superior tech knock it out? If you don't have an iPhone, a laptop and an Apple TV, will you supplant it with something else? Will you use a Google connection to your TV or an Amazon connection to your TV? Will you use Alexa instead of the Google Home version of that? And so did Apple's success need that ecosystem? Yeah, it's a good question. So the question is, is it really a franchise? And I think that's Because I'm a lawyer and I don't come from a consulting background or from a sort of a business facing background, I assume that I don't know the answers to those questions. And I assume that I can't figure them out. I can speculate over a beer with anybody else about whether those things are true or not. But do I want to invest on that basis? No, I want to invest where I think that I can. I want to invest where I think that I can. And I think that's basically what I'm trying to do, like not commit those forced errors, just sort of assume that there's going to be a variety of errors in there. And I think that Apple was one of those examples. 2016 was a different scenario, but very similar idea, but a much better opportunity in 2016 from my perspective, because Einhorn had this idea about, once again, it had built up all this cash on its balance sheet, had got cheap relative to that little sliver of the business that you were paying for after backing up the cash. Earnings were still ridiculously strong. Einhorn, had this proposal called iPrefs, where he was going to spin off some sort of preference shares and spend the money. Icahn came through and just sort of cut through the clutter and said, just buy back a gigantic amount of your stock, which they did. They fought Icahn for a little while and said, no, let's do that. Bought back the stock. It was the biggest buyback announced, I think, at the time. And then they actually bought back more stock than had ever been bought back by a single company. That was in 2016. And then I think Buffett showed up as an investor in the next period of time. And they've just again announced another buyback. So it is one of those companies that has an enormous amount of genuine free cash flow that can use to buy back stock when it gets cheap. And the result is that it performs very well.\n",

And if not, ultimately, how can you build an effective portfolio, making sure that you are aware of all the special situations that are out there and that you are not just subject to the luck of what you come across? So I'd love to get a sense from you, really two things. A, how you think about building a special situations portfolio and setting expectations. For investors. And then B, what parts of the process can be systematized today and do you think can be further systematized in the future?\n",

      " Well, I do think that you are subject to the opportunity set that is available in special situations. It's entirely possible that in any given period of time, there's nothing to do. The good example is at the beginning of 2016, we hadn't done any merger arb, any risk arb. And then the Obama Department of Treasury started to crack down on the reverse mergers that were being done for the purposes of moving headquarters overseas to avoid US tax jurisdictions. And so they said, you're no longer allowed to do that. And when that happened, that blew up a number of deals that were being conducted for that reason. But there were also another group of deals that weren't being conducted for that reason. But they also blew out the spreads between where the bid was and where the stock was trading in the market got very, very wide, sort of to the tune of 30% with deals that were going to close inside the year. So it was in less than nine months, which annually would have been about $1.5 billion. And then the next year, it was $1.5 billion. And so it was going to close inside the year. And then the next year, it was going to close inside the year. And so it was going to close inside the year. And so it's a little bit like the boom and the boom and the boom. So it's a little bit like the boom and the boom. Humana had been very cheap. It had been in the acquirers' multiple for an extended period of time. Six years, it had been one of the cheapest stocks in the multiple, in the screens. And now it had a bid. And whether the bid goes through or not, it's still a very cheap stock, likely to compound at a high rate. If the bid goes through, great, you get a lot of money. So it's a very of front-end loaded returns. So we put that position on. Pretty quickly, that shock that had hit the risk ARBs went away and all of those ARBs closed off. And so we took those positions down a fair bit. Then the Obama DOJ, so not the Department of Treasury, came in and said, well, now this is a competition issue. The combination would have been the second or third biggest company. So United was the biggest. There was another merger that was going through that would be second biggest. If that one got blocked, Humana goes through, that becomes the second biggest. If it doesn't get blocked, it goes through and becomes the third biggest. So we thought, not knowing whether this deal gets blocked or not. Now, the terms are the same. The period where it's going to occur is shorter. Still a very, very high rate of return. Requires a pretty big position to be put on, which we did. It traded down as the market got sort of increasingly nervous about its prospects. We increased the size of the position. On the day that the DOJ announced that they were in fact blocking the deal, the stock jumped, 15%. It's one of those funny things about investing that the very worst outcome that everybody was most nervous about actually comes to fruition. It comes to pass. And then everybody says, well, now the uncertainty is gone. So the stock's up 15%. So we knew that nothing was going to happen until December. So we look at other ways of playing the stock. Can we sell calls in this stock that will expire before the date? There should be almost no value in those positions because you know the upper limit of the bid. So we sold those calls. All expired worthless before the bid. And then the bid was ultimately blocked. They fought it through the courts and they lost. And then the day that that was announced, the stock was up again because over that period of time, United and the other companies in the sector had traded so far ahead of Aetna and Humana, which was sort of weighed down by the deal. They then had a lot of catching up to do and they've performed really well in the space afterwards. So I think that's a good example of a number of things. One of them is that if you're doing special situations, you want an undervalued security first. And then you've got to have a lot of security first. And then you've got to have a lot of security first. That's how you sort of protect your downside. And also there's some return in that. You also have to be aware of other ways of playing the transaction. So not just in the equity, you can get options, puts and calls and different ways of investing in it. And in terms of sizing the position, there's some science around it using the Kelly theory, which I know that we're going to get to at some stage. But then there are lots of reasons why you probably want to undersize Kelly, but you still need to get enough of a position on because they don't come around. Good opportunities don't come around so often that you kind of afford to not sort of put enough money in. So special situations portfolio is always going to be pretty small. Half a dozen to 10 positions would be a pretty full portfolio. And they're traded much more regularly than systematic.\n",

The warrant was cheap relative to the equity. And both of those things together, you get a little performance in the equity, get a lot more performance in the warrant. And we delta hedged that, which meant that we were short the equity, we were long the warrant. Whether you're a special situations investor or not, it's a different profile.

      " There's two very broad approaches. One is just to approach it from the value side first. If you find deeply undervalued stocks, there's some pressure on the management team to do something. The board has to sort of take some action. Do you buy back stock? Do you sell the business? Is an activist going to approach you and force you to do those things anyway? There is some pressure on them to do something. So often the catalyst is about to emerge in that space. So that's one way of doing it. The other way is to start with the transaction. So if you look at the filings, you can set up natural language searches through the filings to return of capital, buyback, special dividend. Anytime those words are, you know, merger, anytime those words are appearing, you've got the filing and is there, you know, then you need to go and see is the stock cheap? Because lots of those things occur in overvalued stocks. But you don't want to be in those ones just in case they come apart because that's how you lose a lot of money. So those are the two very broad approaches. In terms of diversification and sizing, that's a harder question. It's not, you're never going to get the quant approach where you can get equal weighted sector bets. That's not going to happen. You know, that possibility. I think that one good way of doing it though is to do that Kelly betting approach where you look at what's the expected return here? What's our downside? Where's the market pricing this? You can punch those into a Kelly formula and get a bet size. And then basically you want to scale that down because Kelly's always too aggressive. Thorpe's been very successful. So I'm more inclined to take the practical advice than the pure theory. The philosophy behind it is that we're trying to think like private equity investors or activists who would, they're looking for something that's undervalued, but it's a special category of undervaluation. And I know that I've been reading a lot recently about Dan Rasmussen, who's got a private equity approach, but he's literally trying to do private equity on the market. So he's looking for things that have got a lot of debt on the balance sheet that can pay it down. I'm at the other end of that spectrum. I'm looking at things that they might have what you call a lazy balance sheet. They've got too much cash. So that's something that an activist might like that the activist can cause them to pay the money out of buyback stock or just resolve that sort of lazy balance sheet. So that's the idea. You're looking for deep undervaluation that a private equity firm or an activist might be attracted to, which creates hopefully a catalyst in the stock. My experience is that the actual emergence of a takeover or an activist is still pretty rare. Because we're only holding about 30 positions in a long book. So we're looking for things that are deeply undervalued on that metric. We're looking for things that are generating cash flow. So we're matching the cash flows to the accounting earnings. We want to make sure that that's happening on a regular basis. So you can look at accruals, make sure that over time the cash flows are keeping the accounting earnings. We also look for things like if you look at the financing cash flow, so that's how funds itself do they raise cash? Yeah. By selling debt, do they raise cash by selling shares? Do they have a negative financing cash flow from paying a dividend or from buying back stock or from paying down debt? If you find those companies that have the more negative the cash flows, the better those companies tend to do. And I think there's a few reasons why. One of them is that it demonstrates that they do have this genuine free cash flow. They're able to use for purposes outside of the business. Demonstrates that when they're buying back stock, particularly, there's a potential for them to be undervalued. Management's doing the right thing. They're aware of the undervalued. They're aware of the undervalued. They're aware of the undervalued. And I'm looking at these things already as being undervalued. So when something's undervalued on an accounting basis, the cash flows roughly match that accounting undervaluation. Management seem to be doing something about it, buying back stock or paying down debt, paying out dividends. I think when you get all those things together, you get pretty good performance. So they're financially strong. That's a good, solid, long book that you notice that there's nowhere in there. There's a discussion of return on invested capital. We don't do that kind of thing because for those reasons. I discussed earlier, I think you find things that have a potential for mean reversion. And I'm looking for things that have potential for positive mean reversion. You can look at the other side of that to create a short book too. The problem with shorting is that an undervalued stock can remain undervalued for a really long period of time, even though the underlying business is doing better and better. Management's doing the right things. You're still relying on that irrationality that's created the undervaluation to correct itself at some stage. And there's no guarantee that that's going to happen. On the short side, you're also relying on that. So you want something that's very overvalued, fundamentally weak, burning cash. The accounting earnings don't match the cash flow earnings. All of those things exist in lots and lots of companies. And they go up every year by a lot because they're helmed by someone who's very, very charismatic. And they've got that deus ex machina. They've got this way where they keep on. The hero keeps on saving the day by selling stock because people want to be invested in it. Tesla might be an example. An example of that. The fundamentals of the business, the balance sheet, the earnings, the cash flow doesn't look great. But the idea is very powerful. And Musk is an incredible entrepreneur who's been able to raise money lots of different ways. So the risk in a business like that is that charismatic guy raises a whole lot of money and blows you out of position. One of the ways, as a short, you can protect yourself is by looking at the price action. A company, which is not something that value investors typically like to do, but as a short, you have to be prepared to do something a little bit different. So if you're going to do it in a quantitative sense, you have to find things where the momentum has already fallen apart. You don't want to be a hero sort of standing in front of a moving train, trying to stop it with just by standing there. You want to find the thing that's going up the mountain and that's slowed and started to roll backwards. That's what you want to do.\n",

      " Well, it's one of the very first things that we check is the short interest ratio. How heavily short are these stocks? At the time that we're recording this, there's a lot of talk about Tesla being a short and being a very crowded short. But when you look at, and Musk himself has recently come out and said that it's the most shorted stock on the stock market. It's not. I don't think it's in the top 50 most shorted stocks in the stock market. And that might be because people are worried about Musk yanking his shares or some of the big shareholders yanking their shares. I don't think the borrow is too bad on something like Tesla. But that is something that you need to be very, very careful of. There are two ways that we protect ourselves. One of them is we don't short the very most heavily shorted stocks. And by the same token, we don't buy long the very most heavily shorted stocks because they do eventually fall apart. It's just that the cost of carry might eat you alive while you're waiting for them to fall apart. The other way that we do it is that the short book is much smaller than the long book. So a long might be about 4% of the portfolio and a short would be no more than 1%. So a lot can go wrong with a short before it really hurts the portfolio. And then construct a portfolio of shorts. And on balance, that portfolio, all it needs to do is not go up as much as the market when the market goes up and to fall a little bit more than the market when the market goes down.

And it's not a good look if the junior lawyer has a long position in it that he bought a few weeks ago. So we were prevented from investing in just about anything. The first time I really got an opportunity was when I got transferred to the U.S. office. And I thought now it's safe to invest back in Australia.

Because if that happened again, if things got cheap enough, then I would go and dig up all of these net cash, net net, sub liquidation value companies with the additional requirement that they would have an activist who had already filed a 13D in the States.

But I'm a value guy who sort of tries to protect himself from his own behavioral errors by applying that value theory in a systematic way. So I think I've become less theoretically pure as I've gone along and become sort of more, just trying to be more practical. Long short strategies make money when the spread widens and they lose money when the spread tightens up and the spreads aren't really going to follow them. Sometimes when the market's up, the spread is narrowing. Sometimes it's widening. When the market's down, it's a little bit idiosyncratic. The smart way of building that portfolio theoretically might be to do the opposite ends of that spread. But I think that you need a little bit more, the short requires a little bit more tending, the long requires a little bit more different type of tending to work and they need to be thought of independently and they need to stand up independently. Limiting exposure to sectors is something I go back and forth on. It's not something that I want to do. And the reason is that sectors tend to get cheap or expensive at the same, the companies in the sector are all pulled along by each other. When they get really cheap, I think you want to hold more of them and you get there naturally by just applying the screen to the whole market. When they get expensive, I do the opposite, and I think you sort of get there naturally. It's probably, again, not a very academic way, not a very theoretically pure way of applying it. I'm definitely going to be exposed more to that acquirer's multiple factor, which is going to have good performance and it's going to have periods of bad performance. I like it because I like the philosophy behind it. I understand it when I wasn't an investor, when I was a lawyer. I understood the LBO guys and the activists approaching these companies on that basis. I think that it's one of those things that at an individual company level, it's going to be a lot more expensive. I think that it's going to be a lot more expensive. I think that it's going to be a lot more expensive. I think that it's going to understand why each company is in the portfolio. I can look at it and in five minutes understand why it's cheap and why it should be in there. Sometimes I feel like if I use other factors, I lose that reason why it's in the portfolio.

And yet in that book, you ultimately found that I believe it was EBIT, the total enterprise value that reigns supreme on all measures, including sharp, above and beyond using a compound measure approach. And you yourself focus specifically on the acquirer's multiple rather than using a compound measure approach. Can you talk to us a little about why you forego the potential diversification benefits of multiple measures for perhaps the enhanced insight that you get from\n",

      " from the acquirers multiple. So the argument for using the compound measure, Jim O'Shaughnessy, when he first brought out what works on Wall Street, I think it was 1995, he found the best value metric was price to sales. And I think the argument at the time was that sales is sort of undiluted by everything else that occurs down the financial statement. It's the pure, very top line. You can't lie about the top line, even though now we know there are lots of different ways about lying. There are lots of ways that you can lie about the top line, or I've discovered them over the last decade. But in subsequent editions of the book, he said there are different factors had performed better. And I think at some time in the last 10 or 20 years, he advocated for a compound measure because he said each of these factors has periods where they outperform and periods where they underperform. But if you use the compound measure, then you're never going to be the best factor, but you're never going to be the worst factor either. You're in business the whole way through that your portfolio is going to do pretty well. We tested that in quantitative value and found that the compound measure that we tested didn't do as well. As any individual measure, but I'm still very nervous that I sureness is research is pretty good. And I think that that's very, very likely that you see that again in the future. And the way that I get around it is that I say, well, I like the intuition. I like the philosophy of the acquirers mold, but I do acknowledge that there are ways that it can be fooled. Unusual accounting treatments, unusual businesses will fool this metric. So the way that I get around is I screen out everything on the fringes of other metrics. So if it looks cheap on an acquirers multiple basis, very expensive on a price to book basis, it won't be in the portfolio. If it's too expensive on a cashflow basis, it's going to be screened out. It's too expensive on these other metrics, just because I'm nervous that there's something in that particular business that has fooled the multiple. So that's how I deal with it. It has been pretty effective. I think that the multiple has kept on working over the recent period of time. It's entirely possible that it falls apart at some stage too.\n",

I want to rewind really quickly just to give myself a little context because often here in the US we have such a myopic view of our markets right so we experienced the whole tech boom and bust from our own perspective market got very tech heavy my understanding of the Australian equity market is it's much more like Canada where you are very dominated by one or two sectors so I'd love from your experience to get an understanding of how the tech days really did unfold in Australia.\n",

      " That's exactly right. The Australian market, for those who don't know, it's half financials and it's about another third or a sixth based materials, which is mining, which is what you'd expect. Canada is very similar. I think Infotech is like half a percent. And if you look at MSCI, Infotech is something like 12 or 13 percent. I think the States might even be a little more than that. So it's underweight, those kind of things. In the dot-com boom, though, people were. If you could come up with a domain and you had some vague idea about taking over some industry, you could just about launch something out there. Australia is a market that it's a little bit like Canada, probably. It's easy to – there's an appetite for mining, speculative mining, junior mining. They don't have any asset other than an intention to drill something somewhere. And they don't know if they're going to find anything. The equivalent is like maybe a biotech. There's a little bit of it around in the States. But basically – Basically, these things like they have no business model. Their idea is if we find something there, then we're all going to make a lot of money. Most of the time, they don't.\n",
